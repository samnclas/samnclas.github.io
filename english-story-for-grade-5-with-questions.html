They always had a good time and had a contagious laugh, and some people join their bonding, while the rich man only watches them. As days passed on, the rich man's family had a problem. The children became thin, the wife had a cough like the rich man. There was an opposite effect in the narrator's family, they became bright and healthy. Their sickness was not in the food, because their servants were always cooking something delicious to eat. After that, their house was always closed, but the aroma of the food was still drifted by the wind. One morning, a policeman knocked on the door of the narrator's house.

He also agreed that when the rich man's family became sick, their family became strong and healthy. The rich man's children went in shyly. They were really thin and looked sick. When it was time for the rich man, the narrator's father was the one who questioned him. The rich man agreed that while their family was having fun, the rich man's family became worse and sad, and they also stole the spirit of their wealth. He also agreed that the farmer's family stole the spirit of their food by hanging outside their windows while their servants cooked the food. The narrator's father committed to pay the rich man, he took the straw hat and collected some centavo and silver coins around the courtroom. When the father was ready, he went to the rich man and shook the hat in front of the rich man. He asked the man if he heard the spirit of money, and the rich man agreed. In that case, the father told the man that he had already paid. After that, the case was dismissed. The judge told the narrator's father the story where his uncle died because of laughing.

An hour later, you observed that you felt much better. You might conclude that it was the candy bar that made you feel better But there are other possible explanations for the observation. Maybe you had taken some medicine an hour earlier, and it took a while to work. Maybe enough time had passed, and you would have felt better without eating the candy bar. Non-scientific thinking happens all the time. The scientific method is a way of thinking that helps you to avoid drawing incorrect conclusions. It helps you to avoid non-scientific thinking. It reminds you to treat your first conclusion as one of several possible conclusions. It reminds you to gather evidence to support your conclusion. The five steps in the scientific method begin by questioning an observation, and end with a conclusion that is based on evidence Step 1 in the scientific method is to ask a question about your observation, such as, "What makes a sick stomach feel better? Step 2 is to state a possible answer to the question, or a hypothesis, such as, "A candy bar makes a sick stomach feel better." Step 3 is to test the hypothesis. This can be done in many different ways. You could wait until you have a sick stomach again, eat a candy bar, and see what happens. You could ask a lot of people if eating a candy bar had ever made a sick stomach feel better. Figuring out how to test a hypothesis is what makes science challenging. Step 4 is to think about the findings—think about what happened when you tested the hypothesis. Step 5 is to draw a conclusion, and share it with the rest of the world. 1.

Why Does the Ocean Have Waves?
The ocean is never still. Whether observing from the beach or a boat, we expect
to see waves on the horizon. Waves are created by energy passing through
water, causing it to move in a circular motion. However, water does not actually
travel in waves. Waves transmit energy, not water, across the ocean and if not
obstructed by anything, they have the potential to travel across an entire ocean
basin.
Waves are most commonly caused by wind. Wind-driven waves, or surface
waves, are created by the friction between wind and surface water. As wind
blows across the surface of the ocean or a lake, the continual disturbance
creates a wave crest. These types of waves are found globally across the open
ocean and along the coast.
3 │ ENGLISH 4, WEEK 2 QUARTER 4
More potentially hazardous waves can be caused by severe weather, like a
hurricane. The strong winds and pressure from this type of severe storm causes
storm surge, a series of long waves that are created far from shore in deeper
water and intensify as they move closer to land.
Other hazardous waves can be caused by underwater disturbances that
displace large amounts of water quickly such as earthquakes, landslides, or
volcanic eruptions. These very long waves are called tsunamis. Storm surgeand
tsunamis are not the types of waves you imagine crashing down on the shore.
These waves roll upon the shore like a massive sea level rise and can reach far
distances inland. The gravitational pull of the sun and moon on the earth also
causes waves. These waves are tides or, in other words, tidal waves. It is a
common misconception that a tidal wave is also a tsunami. The cause of
tsunamis is not related to tide information at all but can occur in any tidal state.

                                            Now, Read the excerpt from the short story, “My Father Goes to Court” by Carlos Bulosan. Find out how the narrator’s father fulfilled his responsibilities to his family. My Father Goes to Court  by  Carlos BulosanThis story was narrated by a four-year old kid whose family lived in a small town in Luzon. His father’s farm was destroyed by a flood. That was the reason why they preferred to live in a new place. They had a rich man neighbor, and the rich man’s children rarely went outside. Their house was tall, where their family could watch the farmer’s kids play outside their house. The rich man’s Servants were always cooking delicious food like fried chicken, ham, and bacon. The farmer’s family would always take a whiff of the heavenly essence of the rich man’s foods. The narrator’s family always bonds outside in the sun and bathes in the river. They always had a good time and had a contagious laugh, and some people join their bonding, while the rich man only watches them. As days passed on, the rich man’s family had a problem. The children became thin, the wife had a cough like the rich man. There was an opposite effect in the narrator’s family, they became bright and healthy. Their sickness was not in the food, because their servants were always cooking something delicious to eat. After that, their house was always closed, but the aroma of the food was still drifted by the wind. One morning, a policeman knocked on the door of the narrator’s house. The rich man had a complaint against them, because they were accused of stealing the spirit or essence of their food. When the trial came, the narrator’s family came first. After a few minutes, the rich man’s family came with a lawyer, their body was so thin, and they looked sick. The narrator’s father didn’t have any lawyer, he fought on his own. The trial starts, the lawyer questions the narrator’s father. In the first question, the father didn’t agree that they stole the spirit of the wealth and the food.The father agreed in the second question, where he stated that their family hung outside the rich man’s house and inhaled the food. He also agreed that when the rich man’s family became sick, their family became strong and healthy. The rich man’s children went in shyly. They were really thin and looked sick. When it was time for the rich man, the narrator’s father was the one who questioned him. The rich man agreed that while their family was having fun, the rich man’s family became worse and sad, and they also stole the spirit of their wealth. He also agreed that the farmer’s family stole the spirit of their food by hanging outside their windows while their servants cooked the food. The narrator’s father committed to pay the rich man, he took the straw hat and collected some centavo and silver coins around the courtroom. When the father was ready, he went to the rich man and shook the hat in front of the rich man. He asked the man if he heard the spirit of money, and the rich man agreed.

People in the other side. Based on this observation, they believed that the sum travels around the earth. Going directly from observation to conclusion is called non-scientific thinking Here is an example of non-scientific thinking. Maybe you had a sick stomach, and ate a candy bar. An hour later, you observed that you felt much better. You might conclude that it was the candy bar that made you feel better But there are other possible explanations for the observation. Maybe you had taken some medicine an hour earlier, and it took a while to work. Maybe enough time had passed, and you would have felt better without eating the candy bar. Non-scientific thinking happens all the time. The scientific method is a way of thinking that helps you to avoid drawing incorrect conclusions. It helps you to avoid non-scientific thinking. It reminds you to treat your first conclusion as one of several possible conclusions. It reminds you to gather evidence to support your conclusion. The five steps in the scientific method begin by questioning an observation, and end with a conclusion that is based on evidence Step 1 in the scientific method is to ask a question about your observation, such as, "What makes a sick stomach feel better? Step 2 is to state a possible answer to the question, or a hypothesis, such as, "A candy bar makes a sick stomach feel better." Step 3 is to test the hypothesis. This can be done in many different ways. You could wait until you have a sick stomach again, eat a candy bar, and see what happens. You could ask a lot of people if eating a candy bar had ever made a sick stomach feel better. Figuring out how to test a hypothesis is what makes science challenging. Step 4 is to think about the findings—think about what happened when you tested the hypothesis. Step 5 is to draw a conclusion, and share it with the rest of the world. 1. What is this whole story mostly about? A. Going directly from observation to conclusion is called non-scientific thinking. B. The scientific method is a way of thinking that helps you to avoid drawing incorrect conclusions. C. Non-scientific thinking happens all the time. 2. Which of these is a small piece of information from the story that makes the story more interesting? A. People in ancient times believed that the sun travels around the earth. B.

In the example, there is only one explanation for why a sick stomach would feel better after you ate a candy bar. 4. Which of these is a small piece of information from the story that makes the story more interesting? A. In the example, you could test your hypothesis by not eating a candy bar the next time you have a sick stomach. B. In the example, you could test your hypothesis by eating a different kind of candy bar the next time you have a sick stomach. C.

Read the short story then answer each question.
Why Does the Ocean Have Waves?
The ocean is never still. Whether observing from the beach or a boat, we expect
to see waves on the horizon. Waves are created by energy passing through
water, causing it to move in a circular motion. However, water does not actually
travel in waves. Waves transmit energy, not water, across the ocean and if not
obstructed by anything, they have the potential to travel across an entire ocean
basin.
Waves are most commonly caused by wind. Wind-driven waves, or surface
waves, are created by the friction between wind and surface water. As wind
blows across the surface of the ocean or a lake, the continual disturbance
creates a wave crest. These types of waves are found globally across the open
ocean and along the coast.
3 │ ENGLISH 4, WEEK 2 QUARTER 4
More potentially hazardous waves can be caused by severe weather, like a
hurricane. The strong winds and pressure from this type of severe storm causes
storm surge, a series of long waves that are created far from shore in deeper
water and intensify as they move closer to land.
Other hazardous waves can be caused by underwater disturbances that
displace large amounts of water quickly such as earthquakes, landslides, or
volcanic eruptions. These very long waves are called tsunamis. Storm surgeand
tsunamis are not the types of waves you imagine crashing down on the shore.
These waves roll upon the shore like a massive sea level rise and can reach far
distances inland. The gravitational pull of the sun and moon on the earth also
causes waves. These waves are tides or, in other words, tidal waves. It is a
common misconception that a tidal wave is also a tsunami. The cause of
tsunamis is not related to tide information at all but can occur in any tidal state.

Find out how the narrator’s father fulfilled his responsibilities to his family. My Father Goes to Court  by  Carlos BulosanThis story was narrated by a four-year old kid whose family lived in a small town in Luzon. His father’s farm was destroyed by a flood. That was the reason why they preferred to live in a new place. They had a rich man neighbor, and the rich man’s children rarely went outside. Their house was tall, where their family could watch the farmer’s kids play outside their house. The rich man’s Servants were always cooking delicious food like fried chicken, ham, and bacon. The farmer’s family would always take a whiff of the heavenly essence of the rich man’s foods. The narrator’s family always bonds outside in the sun and bathes in the river. They always had a good time and had a contagious laugh, and some people join their bonding, while the rich man only watches them. As days passed on, the rich man’s family had a problem. The children became thin, the wife had a cough like the rich man. There was an opposite effect in the narrator’s family, they became bright and healthy. Their sickness was not in the food, because their servants were always cooking something delicious to eat. After that, their house was always closed, but the aroma of the food was still drifted by the wind. One morning, a policeman knocked on the door of the narrator’s house. The rich man had a complaint against them, because they were accused of stealing the spirit or essence of their food. When the trial came, the narrator’s family came first. After a few minutes, the rich man’s family came with a lawyer, their body was so thin, and they looked sick. The narrator’s father didn’t have any lawyer, he fought on his own. The trial starts, the lawyer questions the narrator’s father. In the first question, the father didn’t agree that they stole the spirit of the wealth and the food.The father agreed in the second question, where he stated that their family hung outside the rich man’s house and inhaled the food. He also agreed that when the rich man’s family became sick, their family became strong and healthy. The rich man’s children went in shyly. They were really thin and looked sick. When it was time for the rich man, the narrator’s father was the one who questioned him. The rich man agreed that while their family was having fun, the rich man’s family became worse and sad, and they also stole the spirit of their wealth. He also agreed that the farmer’s family stole the spirit of their food by hanging outside their windows while their servants cooked the food. The narrator’s father committed to pay the rich man, he took the straw hat and collected some centavo and silver coins around the courtroom. When the father was ready, he went to the rich man and shook the hat in front of the rich man. He asked the man if he heard the spirit of money, and the rich man agreed. In that case, the father told the man that he had already paid. After that, the case was dismissed. The judge told the narrator’s father the story where his uncle died because of laughing. The judge likes to hear the narrator's family laughing. The kid’s sisters started to laugh, and all of the people in the courtroom laughed and the judge’s laugh was the loudest of all.
