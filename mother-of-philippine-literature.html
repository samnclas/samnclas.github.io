One day, a shoot came out of the side of the Mother Banana tree. He was husky, dark-covered, and thick-leafed. The Mother Banana tree noticed the difference between the newcomer and her other shoots. She said nothing about her impressions. complained, so she gave in to their desire. The other shoots did not keep silent, however. And one of them said: "Move away, you dark one. You are not one of us. You are ugly and not graceful." The little shoot moved some distance away, and there he grew even darker and stronger. One day, the sky grew dark and poured heavy rains. Lightning and thunder broke out. When the strong wind blew hard at the Mother Banana tree and the vain shoots around her, they wailed as her leaves were tattered to pieces. The wind kept blowing harder until the banana family was threatened to be toppled to the ground. The dark-colored shoot, seeing the banana family in peril, uprooted himself from the ground and wound his body around the family, thus saving them. The dark shoot was limp but was still alive when the storm blew over. Filled with remorse, the other shoots shouted to one another, "Habaka, Habaka, "meaning "Lift him, lift him." They lifted him and placed him in a dark place beside them. There he grew strong and sturdy. The Mother Banana pitied the dark-colored shoot and tried to extend her leaves to shade him from the sun. But the other shoots From the wailing of the banana shoots for their dark-colored brother, Habaka," the present "Habaka, name "abaca" was derived. - Compiled by: Damiana Eugeni Philippine Folk Literature, 199​</a>

                                            Hero of the epic Biag ni Lam-Ang of the IlocanoLAM-ANG is the hero of one of the most popular Philippine folk epics, Biag ni Lam-ang (Life of Lam-Ang). The Biag ni Lam-ang, from the people of the northern Philippines, is said to be the only complete epic from a Christianized Philippine indigenous group. Exhibiting a mixture of Spanish and indigenous cultures, the earliest written record of the epic was in 1889. There are at least ten versions of the epic.SYNOPSIS OF BIAG NI LAM-ANGNamongan gives birth to a baby with incredible strength and courage, named Lam-ang. The boy asks his mother about his father’s whereabouts and learns that he has gone to fight the Igorot. Lam-ang arms himself with charms and decides to look for his father. From a dream, he learns that his father, Don Juan Panganiban, had been killed by the Igorot.Later, Lam-ang finds the Igorot in a sagang, a feast celebrating a successful headhunting expedition. His father’s head is dis-played in the feast. Lam-ang slays them all with his spear and mutilates the last among them.When Lam-ang returns home, 99 maidens wash his hair in the river. For his shampoo, he burns so many rice straw that the communities near the river are alarmed by the smoke. The dirt from his hair kills all the fishes in the river. He then kills a crocodile and carries it on his shoulder ashore amidst the applause of his companions.Lam-ang hears about a beautiful maiden named Ines Cannoyan, the daughter of the richest man in the town of Kalanutian. He tells his mother of his desire to court the maiden. Although his mother discourages him, he goes anyway, dressed in gold and accompanied by his pet rooster and white dog. The giant Sumarang blocks his way and belittles him. Lam-ang defeats him in a duel and hurls him nine hills away. Later, Sarindadan tries to seduce him but Lam-ang rejects her advances.Reaching Kalanutian, he impresses Ines with his magic. His rooster crows and topples a small outhouse. His dog barks and the outhouse is rebuilt. Ines invites him to the house where the rooster acts as Lam-ang’s spokesperson. Ines’ parents ask for a bride price, which Lam-ang agrees to give.Lam-ang returns home to prepare for the wedding and the presents. He and his townsfolk sail on two golden ships to Kalanutian where Lam-ang and Ines have a Catholic wedding. The townspeople board the two ships to Nalbuan, Lam-ang’s birthplace, to continue the celebration.After the celebration, Lam-ang agrees to hunt rarang, a shellfish. He is swallowed by a giant fish, called berkakang, as he has dreamt so. However, a diver recovers his bones. The pet rooster flaps its wings and resurrects Lam-ang. He then rewards the diver and lives happily with his wife and pets.— CCP Encyclopedia of Philippine Art: Philippine Literature, Volume 9 (Cultural Center of the Philippines, 1994)​</a>

One day, a shoot came out of the side of the Mother Banana tree. He was husky, dark-covered, and thick-leafed. The Mother Banana tree noticed the difference between the newcomer and her other shoots. She said nothing about her impressions. complained, so she gave in to their desire. The other shoots did not keep silent, however. And one of them said: "Move away, you dark one. You are not one of us. You are ugly and not graceful." The little shoot moved some distance away, and there he grew even darker and stronger. One day, the sky grew dark and poured heavy rains. Lightning and thunder broke out. When the strong wind blew hard at the Mother Banana tree and the vain shoots around her, they wailed as her leaves were tattered to pieces. The wind kept blowing harder until the banana family was threatened to be toppled to the ground. The dark-colored shoot, seeing the banana family in peril, uprooted himself from the ground and wound his body around the family, thus saving them. The dark shoot was limp but was still alive when the storm blew over. Filled with remorse, the other shoots shouted to one another, "Habaka, Habaka, "meaning "Lift him, lift him." They lifted him and placed him in a dark place beside them. There he grew strong and sturdy. The Mother Banana pitied the dark-colored shoot and tried to extend her leaves to shade him from the sun. But the other shoots From the wailing of the banana shoots for their dark-colored brother, Habaka," the present "Habaka, name "abaca" was derived. - Compiled by: Damiana Eugeni Philippine Folk Literature, 199​</h2><br />

                            20. Hero of the epic Biag ni Lam-Ang of the IlocanoLAM-ANG is the hero of one of the most popular Philippine folk epics, Biag ni Lam-ang (Life of Lam-Ang). The Biag ni Lam-ang, from the people of the northern Philippines, is said to be the only complete epic from a Christianized Philippine indigenous group. Exhibiting a mixture of Spanish and indigenous cultures, the earliest written record of the epic was in 1889. There are at least ten versions of the epic.SYNOPSIS OF BIAG NI LAM-ANGNamongan gives birth to a baby with incredible strength and courage, named Lam-ang. The boy asks his mother about his father’s whereabouts and learns that he has gone to fight the Igorot. Lam-ang arms himself with charms and decides to look for his father. From a dream, he learns that his father, Don Juan Panganiban, had been killed by the Igorot.Later, Lam-ang finds the Igorot in a sagang, a feast celebrating a successful headhunting expedition. His father’s head is dis-played in the feast. Lam-ang slays them all with his spear and mutilates the last among them.When Lam-ang returns home, 99 maidens wash his hair in the river. For his shampoo, he burns so many rice straw that the communities near the river are alarmed by the smoke. The dirt from his hair kills all the fishes in the river. He then kills a crocodile and carries it on his shoulder ashore amidst the applause of his companions.Lam-ang hears about a beautiful maiden named Ines Cannoyan, the daughter of the richest man in the town of Kalanutian. He tells his mother of his desire to court the maiden. Although his mother discourages him, he goes anyway, dressed in gold and accompanied by his pet rooster and white dog. The giant Sumarang blocks his way and belittles him. Lam-ang defeats him in a duel and hurls him nine hills away. Later, Sarindadan tries to seduce him but Lam-ang rejects her advances.Reaching Kalanutian, he impresses Ines with his magic. His rooster crows and topples a small outhouse. His dog barks and the outhouse is rebuilt. Ines invites him to the house where the rooster acts as Lam-ang’s spokesperson. Ines’ parents ask for a bride price, which Lam-ang agrees to give.Lam-ang returns home to prepare for the wedding and the presents. He and his townsfolk sail on two golden ships to Kalanutian where Lam-ang and Ines have a Catholic wedding. The townspeople board the two ships to Nalbuan, Lam-ang’s birthplace, to continue the celebration.After the celebration, Lam-ang agrees to hunt rarang, a shellfish. He is swallowed by a giant fish, called berkakang, as he has dreamt so. However, a diver recovers his bones. The pet rooster flaps its wings and resurrects Lam-ang. He then rewards the diver and lives happily with his wife and pets.— CCP Encyclopedia of Philippine Art: Philippine Literature, Volume 9 (Cultural Center of the Philippines, 1994)​</h2><br />
