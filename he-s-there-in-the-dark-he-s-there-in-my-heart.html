And the saw snarled and rattled, snarled and rattled, As it ran light, or had to bear a load. And nothing happened: day was all but done, Call it a day, I wish they might have said To please the boy by giving him the half hour That a boy counts so much when saved from work. His sister stood beside them in her apron To tell them "Supper." At the word, the saw, As if to prove saws knew what supper meant, Leaped out at the boy's hand, or seemed to leap- y He must have given the hand. However it was, Neither refused the meeting. But the hand! at The boy's first outcry was a rueful laugh, As he swung toward them holding up the hand Half in appeal, but half as if to keep A The life from spilling. Then the boy saw all- Since he was old enough to know, big boy it Doing a man's work, though a child at heart- all He saw all spoiled. "Don't let him cut my hand off- The doctor, when he comes. Don't let him, sister!" n So. But the hand was gone already. e The doctor put him in the dark of ether. S, He lay and puffed his lips out with his breath. ed And then the watcher at his pulse took fright. $; No one believed. They listened at his heart. Little-less-nothing! --and that ended it. art No more to build on there. And they, since they Were not the one dead, turned to their affairs. 1. What happens in this poem? 2.

Back then, people believed they will get rich if they find gold. So much has changed for the
past 50 years.
____2. You will never understand pain as much as I did. Imagine your brain telling you to
that you will never be worthy of anything. This is my life. This is depression.
____3. I am a sinner. Of course, I am. But I never chose this life. This town, the owners, the
slaves – they made me who I am. I gambled and robbed and destroyed lives and you don’t
know what I am talking about, Officer Lambert!
____4. It was snowing that November. The castle was dark and cold. The grand priest poured
soup on the ground from the boiled pork. The thick steam that warmed my heart quickly
disappeared when I saw the orphans begged the grand priest for leftovers.
____5. I will never understand teachers who fail my other classmates. Students are supposed
to study, yes. But aren’t teachers supposed to teach? No one taught me! I only have a bunch
of papers begging me to answer them.</a>

Benny flickered a switch on the wall. Nolight."Felicity!" Benny called again. No reply. It was spooky, just like being in a hauntedhouse at midnight on Halloween. I reached out and touched Benny. He screamed"Don't do that!" he roared.We stood together in the hall, listening. We heard nothing but the sound of ourown panting breath. Shadowy figures loomed up in the dark. My heart poundedfaster than a prize-fighter's glove in a little fight."Ghosts!" | squealed, pointing at the advancing shadows."Help!" shrieked Benny.We turned and ran. The ghosts grabbed us. For ghosts, they sure hit hard. Theyhit so hard we were knocked to the ground. The laughed as they clouted us: onetwo, one two."I told you I'd get even with you," panted Felicity.By the time Graham turned the electricity back on at the fuse box outside, Bennyand I had recovered... sort of. Felicity threatened to dab us in if we didn't go tobed, so we went.PAN-STSource: A Night at Benny's by Dianne BatesCore English &amp; Mathematics​</a>

Out, Out by Robert Frost The buzz-saw snarled and rattled in the yard And made dust and dropped stove-length sticks of wood, Sweet-scented stuff when the breeze drew across it And from there those that lifted eyes could count Five mountain ranges one behind the other Under the sunset far into Vermont. And the saw snarled and rattled, snarled and rattled, As it ran light, or had to bear a load. And nothing happened: day was all but done, Call it a day, I wish they might have said To please the boy by giving him the half hour That a boy counts so much when saved from work. His sister stood beside them in her apron To tell them "Supper." At the word, the saw, As if to prove saws knew what supper meant, Leaped out at the boy's hand, or seemed to leap- y He must have given the hand. However it was, Neither refused the meeting. But the hand! at The boy's first outcry was a rueful laugh, As he swung toward them holding up the hand Half in appeal, but half as if to keep A The life from spilling. Then the boy saw all- Since he was old enough to know, big boy it Doing a man's work, though a child at heart- all He saw all spoiled. "Don't let him cut my hand off- The doctor, when he comes. Don't let him, sister!" n So. But the hand was gone already. e The doctor put him in the dark of ether. S, He lay and puffed his lips out with his breath. ed And then the watcher at his pulse took fright. $; No one believed. They listened at his heart. Little-less-nothing! --and that ended it. art No more to build on there. And they, since they Were not the one dead, turned to their affairs. 1. What happens in this poem? 2.

____1. He went to the gold mines everyday for three years before succumbing to his illness.
Back then, people believed they will get rich if they find gold. So much has changed for the
past 50 years.
____2. You will never understand pain as much as I did. Imagine your brain telling you to
that you will never be worthy of anything. This is my life. This is depression.
____3. I am a sinner. Of course, I am. But I never chose this life. This town, the owners, the
slaves – they made me who I am. I gambled and robbed and destroyed lives and you don’t
know what I am talking about, Officer Lambert!
____4. It was snowing that November. The castle was dark and cold. The grand priest poured
soup on the ground from the boiled pork. The thick steam that warmed my heart quickly
disappeared when I saw the orphans begged the grand priest for leftovers.
____5. I will never understand teachers who fail my other classmates. Students are supposed
to study, yes. But aren’t teachers supposed to teach? No one taught me! I only have a bunch
of papers begging me to answer them.</h2><br />
