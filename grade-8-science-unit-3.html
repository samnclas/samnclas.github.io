WHICH BEST FITS ME!!Directions: Choose your correct answers from the highlighted wordsbelow that would fit the idea given about factors that affects Potential and Kinetic Energy. Write your answer in your answer in your answer sheets._____________11. At a lower temperature, particles of the medium are moving more slowly, so it takes them (longer, shorter) time to transfer the energy of the sound waves._____________12. Temperature is also a condition that affects the speed of sound. Molecules at (higher, lower) temperatures have more energy, thus they can vibrate faster, therefore sound waves can travel more quickly._____________13. As the temperature (increases, decreases), particles vibrate slowly, then sound travels faster._____________14. Sound moves (faster, slower) in warm air than colder air, the wave bends away from the warm air and back toward the ground. That's why sound is able to travel farther on a cold days._____________15. The higher the temperature of the medium, the (higher, lower) is the speed of sound in the medium.​</a>

The energyproduced is determined similarly to kinetic which depends on its objects  mass, gravitational pull and _____.8. Kinetic energy can be affected by velocity, while potential energy can be affected by ___, as shown in a situation of a boulder on the tip of a cliff,  that wind could move it so slightly so that it could come crashing down.9. The amount of kinetic energy an object has is related to the object's speedand ____.10. Water that is behind a dam, A car that is parked at the top of a hill, and A yoyo before it is released are examples of _____.C. WHICH BEST FITS ME!!Directions: Choose your correct answers from the highlighted wordsbelow that would fit the idea given about factors that affects Potential and Kinetic Energy. Write your answer in your answer in your answer sheets._____________11. At a lower temperature, particles of the medium are moving more slowly, so it takes them (longer, shorter) time to transfer the energy of the sound waves._____________12. Temperature is also a condition that affects the speed of sound. Molecules at (higher, lower) temperatures have more energy, thus they can vibrate faster, therefore sound waves can travel more quickly._____________13. As the temperature (increases, decreases), particles vibrate slowly, then sound travels faster._____________14. Sound moves (faster, slower) in warm air than colder air, the wave bends away from the warm air and back toward the ground. That's why sound is able to travel farther on a cold days._____________15. The higher the temperature of the medium, the (higher, lower) is the speed of sound in the medium.​</h2><br />

Given:</p><p>  mass of truck= 2000kg</p><p>   velocity of truck = 0 m/s</p><p>   mass of bike + biker = 60kg</p><p>   velocity of bike + biker = 5m/s</p><p></p><p>The <strong>bike and biker has greater kinetic energy than the truck.</strong> <strong>Kinetic energy is the energy in motion</strong>. Mathematically, kinetic energy is represented by the formula, <strong>KE = </strong>[tex]\frac{1}{2}[/tex]<strong> m</strong>[tex]v^{2}[/tex]. It means that kinetic energy is directly proportional to the object's mass and the square of the velocity. The faster the object moves, the greater the kinetic energy. The truck is parked on a curb, thus, has zero velocity. Since the truck is at rest, it will also have no kinetic energy. In contrast to the bike and biker that is in motion thus possesses kinetic energy. Using the formula,<strong> the truck will have zero kinetic energy while the bike and biker will have a kinetic energy of 750 J. </strong></p><p></p><p>2. Given:</p><p>    mass of pig = 50 kg</p><p>    height = 0 m</p><p>    mass of banana = 50 kg</p><p>    height = 10m</p><p>    g = 9.8 m/[tex]s^{2}[/tex]</p><p></p><p>Between the banana and pig, <strong>the banana will have greater potential energy. </strong>Even though the pig and banana have the same mass, the <strong>position of the two objects caused the difference in their potential energies.</strong> <strong>Potential energy is energy at rest or stored energy.</strong> It is affected by the mass, height, and pull of gravity. Specifically, potential energy is directly proportional to mass and height. The pull of gravity on earth is constant and the acceleration due to the gravity (g) is 9.8 m/[tex]s^{2}[/tex]. Potential energy is represented by the formula, <strong>PE =mgh.</strong> In the question, the pig is lying on the floor, thus having a zero height. Substituting the values to the formula of potential energy, <strong>the pig has zero potential energy</strong>. On the other hand, the banana is hanging 10 m from the ground. Substituting the values to the formula of the potential energy, <strong>the banana will have a potential energy of 4, 900 J. </strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>#BRAINLYFAST</p><p></p><br />
