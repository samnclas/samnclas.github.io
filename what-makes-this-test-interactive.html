The aisle of Bosilica Menor de Tayabas is perfect for the bride's most memorable walk in her life, The Basilica Menor de Tayabas is known for having the longest aisle among the churches buit during the Spanish colonial era. 5 Malagonlong Bridge is one among the Spanish-era bridges in Tayabas. The thought of children sold to be kidnapped and their blood used in the construction of bridges to make them strong and stand the test of time is scary Directions Reflect on what you learned on this lesson about factual information and subiective content by completing the statements below ​</a>

                                            Please read this text afterwards, answer the questions that follows.
 There are six types of peer pressure and tips for parents to help their child
make healthy, life-long choices:
1.Spoken peer pressure is when a teenager asks, suggests, persuades, or
otherwise directs another to engage in a specific behavior. If the spoken
influence takes place within a group, the pressure to go along with the group
is immense. 
2. With unspoken peer pressure, a teenager is exposed to the actions of one
or more peers and is left to choose whether they want to follow along. This
could take the form of fashion choices, personal interactions or ‘joining’
types of behavior (clubs, teams, etc). Many young teens lack the mental
maturity to control impulses and make wise long-term decisions. 
3. Direct peer pressure can be spoken or unspoken. It is normally behavior
centric. Examples of these kinds of behavior would be when a teenager
hands another teen an alcoholic drink, or make a sexual advance, or looks
at another student’s paper during a test. The other student is put in a
position of having to make an on-the-spot decision. 
4. Like unspoken peer pressure, indirect peer pressure is subtle but can still
exert a strong influence on an impressionable young person. When a teen
overhears a friend gossiping about another person and then reacts to the
gossip, that is indirect peer pressure. 
5. Asking a teenager to engage in behavior that is against his/her moral
code or family values is a type of negative peer pressure. Teens see the
actions of other teens with stronger personalities and are put in a position of
following the leader or walking away. Young people often lack the skills to
say no to negative peer pressure. 
6. A group of dynamic can be a positive peer influence if the behaviors are
healthy, age appropriate and socially acceptable. For instance, if a peer
group wants to make good grades, a young teen can be positively influenced
to study. Or if a popular friend wants to earn money and save, a young
teenager may also be influenced to save and open a savings account. 
1. Why do you think Peer Pressure is a good topic to read and share to
others?

By senior high school most students have, in fact, mastered the mechanics of reading. Specifically, students have learned to decode-or translate printed words into understandable sounds and language. It can be said that by college must students have progressed from “learning to read” to “reading to learn”. In the “reading to learn” phase, however, many students find themselves struggling to understand what they have read.Students find they can read words, but they do not always comprehend what they are reading. There are several reasons that contribute to this dilemma. First, 85-90 percent of what students learn in school comes from textbooks; most of the writing in textbooks is expository, or factual and informational. Research shows that expository writing is more difficult to comprehend than narrative writing, which generally tells astory. A second reason for the dilemma is that, as students’ progress from one grade to another, the complexity of reading comprehension becomes greater. Students with reading comprehension problems tend to fall farther behind each year.There is, however, help for struggling reader. There are “tools” or strategies that students can use to organize and manage their learning. Research shows that teaching students’ strategies to enable them to interact with what they are reading increase comprehension. In fact, the difference between successful and unsuccessful readers is actually reflected in their ability to effectively apply these strategies. Because of the correlation between the use of strategies and reading comprehension, it is extremely important that all teachers, not just English or reading teachers, structure their lessons to help students become purposeful readers. Having a purpose for reading makes students more focused, which, in turn, helps them understand and remember what they have read.Most teachers may not be trained to teach students to read (decode), but every teacher can teach reading strategies in their particular content. It has been said that good readers: are active readers; set goals for reading; including identifying the purpose for their reading; skim material before they read, noting things that are related to their goals; integrate their prior knowledge and make personal connections; develop questions that they hope to answer during the reading; make predictions about what is to come in the reading; monitor their understanding of the reading; try to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words or concepts; respond to text in a variety of ways; create visual representation to aid comprehension and recall; and determine important ideas.Teaching the strategies that will follow will enable students to develop all the traits of a good reader. The strategies include before reading are: SQ3R, Think-PairShare, KWL, and predicting.During reading strategies increase comprehension. These includes monitoring structure: finding the main idea/ details, sequencing/ordering, comparing/contrasting,and cause/effect, using context clues, determining fact from opinion, and inferring. Strategies to address special skills are interpreting photographs, political cartoons, graphs, charts, tables, maps are also included.After reading strategies help to assess comprehension and expand knowledge. It includes summarizing, paraphrasing, synthesizing, and testing.Questions:1. In this text, what is the main idea?2. Summarize the text in five sentences.3. Would this be considered academic text? Why or why not?4. List or underline each hedging expression used in the text.</a>

                            11. Please read this text afterwards, answer the questions that follows.
 There are six types of peer pressure and tips for parents to help their child
make healthy, life-long choices:
1.Spoken peer pressure is when a teenager asks, suggests, persuades, or
otherwise directs another to engage in a specific behavior. If the spoken
influence takes place within a group, the pressure to go along with the group
is immense. 
2. With unspoken peer pressure, a teenager is exposed to the actions of one
or more peers and is left to choose whether they want to follow along. This
could take the form of fashion choices, personal interactions or ‘joining’
types of behavior (clubs, teams, etc). Many young teens lack the mental
maturity to control impulses and make wise long-term decisions. 
3. Direct peer pressure can be spoken or unspoken. It is normally behavior
centric. Examples of these kinds of behavior would be when a teenager
hands another teen an alcoholic drink, or make a sexual advance, or looks
at another student’s paper during a test. The other student is put in a
position of having to make an on-the-spot decision. 
4. Like unspoken peer pressure, indirect peer pressure is subtle but can still
exert a strong influence on an impressionable young person. When a teen
overhears a friend gossiping about another person and then reacts to the
gossip, that is indirect peer pressure. 
5. Asking a teenager to engage in behavior that is against his/her moral
code or family values is a type of negative peer pressure. Teens see the
actions of other teens with stronger personalities and are put in a position of
following the leader or walking away. Young people often lack the skills to
say no to negative peer pressure. 
6. A group of dynamic can be a positive peer influence if the behaviors are
healthy, age appropriate and socially acceptable. For instance, if a peer
group wants to make good grades, a young teen can be positively influenced
to study. Or if a popular friend wants to earn money and save, a young
teenager may also be influenced to save and open a savings account. 
1. Why do you think Peer Pressure is a good topic to read and share to
others?
2. Explain how the following skills help you in summarizing:
a. Getting the main idea:
__________________________________________________________________
b. Noting supporting details:

By senior high school most students have, in fact, mastered the mechanics of reading. Specifically, students have learned to decode-or translate printed words into understandable sounds and language. It can be said that by college must students have progressed from “learning to read” to “reading to learn”. In the “reading to learn” phase, however, many students find themselves struggling to understand what they have read.Students find they can read words, but they do not always comprehend what they are reading. There are several reasons that contribute to this dilemma. First, 85-90 percent of what students learn in school comes from textbooks; most of the writing in textbooks is expository, or factual and informational. Research shows that expository writing is more difficult to comprehend than narrative writing, which generally tells astory. A second reason for the dilemma is that, as students’ progress from one grade to another, the complexity of reading comprehension becomes greater. Students with reading comprehension problems tend to fall farther behind each year.There is, however, help for struggling reader. There are “tools” or strategies that students can use to organize and manage their learning. Research shows that teaching students’ strategies to enable them to interact with what they are reading increase comprehension. In fact, the difference between successful and unsuccessful readers is actually reflected in their ability to effectively apply these strategies. Because of the correlation between the use of strategies and reading comprehension, it is extremely important that all teachers, not just English or reading teachers, structure their lessons to help students become purposeful readers. Having a purpose for reading makes students more focused, which, in turn, helps them understand and remember what they have read.Most teachers may not be trained to teach students to read (decode), but every teacher can teach reading strategies in their particular content. It has been said that good readers: are active readers; set goals for reading; including identifying the purpose for their reading; skim material before they read, noting things that are related to their goals; integrate their prior knowledge and make personal connections; develop questions that they hope to answer during the reading; make predictions about what is to come in the reading; monitor their understanding of the reading; try to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words or concepts; respond to text in a variety of ways; create visual representation to aid comprehension and recall; and determine important ideas.Teaching the strategies that will follow will enable students to develop all the traits of a good reader. The strategies include before reading are: SQ3R, Think-PairShare, KWL, and predicting.During reading strategies increase comprehension. These includes monitoring structure: finding the main idea/ details, sequencing/ordering, comparing/contrasting,and cause/effect, using context clues, determining fact from opinion, and inferring. Strategies to address special skills are interpreting photographs, political cartoons, graphs, charts, tables, maps are also included.After reading strategies help to assess comprehension and expand knowledge. It includes summarizing, paraphrasing, synthesizing, and testing.Questions:1. In this text, what is the main idea?2. Summarize the text in five sentences.3. Would this be considered academic text? Why or why not?4. List or underline each hedging expression used in the text.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The main idea of the text is that many students struggle with reading comprehension despite mastering the mechanics of reading, but there are strategies that can help improve comprehension.</p><p></p><p>2. The text discusses how students often struggle with reading comprehension despite learning to decode words, and how the complexity of reading comprehension increases as students progress through school. It highlights the importance of teaching students strategies to improve their comprehension, and lists several strategies that can be used before, during, and after reading. Finally, it emphasizes the need for all teachers to structure their lessons to help students become purposeful readers.</p><p></p><p>3. This text could be considered academic because it discusses research findings and provides strategies for improving reading comprehension, which are relevant to students in an academic context.</p><p></p><p>4.
