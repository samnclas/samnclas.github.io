Front liners emulates Jose Rizal’s self-sacrifice
Christina Mendez (The Philippine Star)June 20, 2020 - 12:00am
MANILA, Philippines — Malacañang officials compared thousands of Filipino health workers and other frontline workers engaged in addressing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) here and abroad to the heroism of Dr. Jose Rizal, whose 159th birth anniversary was marked yesterday.
Presidential Communications Operations Office chief Secretary Martin Andanar and presidential spokesman Harry Roque Jr. talked about how Rizal’s patriotism and self-sacrifice are reflected in the sacrifices of Filipino health workers, medical doctors and other frontliners in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.
Andanar noted how Rizal strongly displayed nationalism and patriotism throughout his life, which “greatly contributed to our forefathers’ pursuit of justice, freedom and independence against our colonizers.”
“Today, as we face the threat of an unseen enemy in this pandemic... like Dr. Jose Rizal, may we utilize our intelligence in our fight against COVID-19 and may we find the strength of heart to continue on our path to recovery,” Andanar said. He urged the Filipino people to continue to be inspired by the legacy left by the country’s national hero, citing his brilliance, compassion, bravery, peaceful resistance and selfless and wholehearted service to the country.
For Roque, Rizal’s life is “a testament of how a single person’s deep love for his country could spark the reawakening of our forefathers’ desire for freedom and change.”
The occasion reminds the nation of Rizal’s young life, dedicated to service, which rings a bell in these challenging times. “We are proud to see today modern-day heroes – our courageous front liners – who rise up to the challenge and serve as beacons of hope to a people weary and fearful of the present global health scare,” Roque said. Roque rallied the youth to be inspired by Rizal’s way of life to help steer the country to greater heights.

Please you can my question about the subject RIZAL today. Thank you!</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>There is one issue in Jose Rizal’s life that historians have debated on several occasions but remains unsettled. That issue is whether Rizal, on the eve of his death, re-embraced the Catholic faith and disassociated himself from Masonry. The matter is controversial because parties on both sides are affiliated with an organization that promotes moral values and the pursuit of truth. The pro-retraction camp is represented by the Jesuits, the archbishop of Manila, and a few other members of the Catholic hierarchy. Since they are all ordained priests, they are assumed to be truthful in their pronouncements. Their opponents are the members of Masonry, an organization that promotes brotherhood, integrity, decency, and professionalism.</p><p>      This paper resurrects the retraction controversy in the light of the emergence of another primary source that speaks about what happened to Rizal on the eve of his death. This document was never considered in the history of the retraction controversy because it was made available to researchers only in the past decade. The author of the report is a credible eyewitness because he was physically present in the vicinity of where Rizal was detained. His narrative is lucid and contains details that cast doubt on the credibility and reliability of earlier primary sources on which previous narratives were based. This document needs serious consideration and should be included in the discourse on Rizal’s retraction.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>that is my answer po</p><p>hope it helps po</p><p>God bless you</p><br />

In your own opinion, how is nationalism or patriotism best Exhibited? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Name: Jane Smith</p><p>Address: 123 Main St. Anytown, USA</p><p>Birthdate: June 15, 1985</p><p>Birthplace: Chicago, Illinois, USA</p><p>Highest Educational Attainment: Bachelor's Degree in Education</p><p>Principle in life: Treat others as you would like to be treated.</p><p></p><p>1. Jose Rizal is a true hero not only for Filipinos but for people all over the world. He used his talents and intelligence to fight for the rights and freedom of his countrymen. His sacrifice and bravery inspired many generations to stand up for what is right and just. For me, he embodies what a hero should be - selfless, intelligent, and compassionate.</p><p></p><p>2. Like Jose Rizal, I value education and the pursuit of knowledge. I believe that education is the key to unlocking opportunities and achieving one's dreams. I also share his love for literature, art, and music. He was a well-rounded individual who excelled in many fields, and I also strive for a balanced and fulfilling life.</p><p></p><p>3. One thing that I have differently from Jose Rizal is my nationality and cultural background. Although we share a common humanity, we have different experiences and perspectives shaped by our upbringing and environment. I also have not faced the same kind of oppression and injustice that he did as a Filipino living under Spanish colonial rule.</p><p></p><p>4. One vivid memory I have about love of country is when I participated in a rally for immigrant rights. There were people from different countries and cultures, but we all came together to demand equality and respect for all. It was inspiring to see people of different backgrounds unite for a common cause and fight for what they believe in.</p><p></p><p>5. In my opinion, nationalism or patriotism is best exhibited by serving others and the greater good. This can be done in many ways, such as volunteering in your community, standing up for the rights of marginalized groups, or contributing to the development of your country. It does not necessarily mean blindly following your government or country, but doing what is right and just for the benefit of all. Jose Rizal exhibited this kind of nationalism through his writings, advocacy, and sacrifice for his country.</p><br />

Front liners emulates Jose Rizal’s self-sacrifice
Christina Mendez (The Philippine Star)June 20, 2020 - 12:00am
MANILA, Philippines — Malacañang officials compared thousands of Filipino health workers and other frontline workers engaged in addressing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) here and abroad to the heroism of Dr. Jose Rizal, whose 159th birth anniversary was marked yesterday.
Presidential Communications Operations Office chief Secretary Martin Andanar and presidential spokesman Harry Roque Jr. talked about how Rizal’s patriotism and self-sacrifice are reflected in the sacrifices of Filipino health workers, medical doctors and other frontliners in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.
Andanar noted how Rizal strongly displayed nationalism and patriotism throughout his life, which “greatly contributed to our forefathers’ pursuit of justice, freedom and independence against our colonizers.”
“Today, as we face the threat of an unseen enemy in this pandemic... like Dr. Jose Rizal, may we utilize our intelligence in our fight against COVID-19 and may we find the strength of heart to continue on our path to recovery,” Andanar said. He urged the Filipino people to continue to be inspired by the legacy left by the country’s national hero, citing his brilliance, compassion, bravery, peaceful resistance and selfless and wholehearted service to the country.
For Roque, Rizal’s life is “a testament of how a single person’s deep love for his country could spark the reawakening of our forefathers’ desire for freedom and change.”
The occasion reminds the nation of Rizal’s young life, dedicated to service, which rings a bell in these challenging times. “We are proud to see today modern-day heroes – our courageous front liners – who rise up to the challenge and serve as beacons of hope to a people weary and fearful of the present global health scare,” Roque said. Roque rallied the youth to be inspired by Rizal’s way of life to help steer the country to greater heights.
