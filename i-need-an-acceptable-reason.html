                                            You were not able to prepare for your graded report in Oral Communication. Mr. Reyes, then calls you to go to the front and start your presentation. How are you going to explain your situation yo your teacher?    In this situation, the first thing I would do is to admit that I was not able to prepare for the presentation and explain why. After I finish explaining to Mr. Reyes the reason why I was unprepared, I would then gladly accept the mistake I made and face all the consequences that will come with it. Once I've come to terms with my mistake, I would then apologize to Mr. Reyes for the mishap I have caused. Then, I would ask him if I can redo, the presentation, and do anything to get the grade, if I were given the chance.Your cousin, Karl, calls you over the phone and tells you that he cannot help you in your errand because he needs to do something for his school project. What will you tell him to convince him to spare you a bit of his time and that you need him to buy the surprise birthday gift for your father?    I would politely ask Karl again if he can help me with my errand. I would tell him that I would help him with his school project after we finish the errand. I would also tell him that sparing a bit of his time is already a big help and that I'd appreciate it if he helps me. Once he agrees, I would also promise him that he can also call me when he needs help on another errand.You are about to start with your report which you have failed to prepare for when your mother calls you on your mobile phone. How are you going to respond to your mother? What will you tell her?    I would answer the call first to check with my mother if it was an urgent call. If she tells me that it wasn't urgent, then I would politely ask my mother to wait for me to call her back, as I am about to do a presentation. However, if the call was urgent, I would first ask my teacher if I can spare a few minutes for my mother. If the teacher does not approve, then I will just try to listen to her on speaker phone as I do my presentation.You are in the middle of your discussion about the Tree-Planting Initiative of your school but you noticed that the District Supervisor is not really paying attention to what you are saying. How will you address the Supervisor respectfully?    If I saw the supervisor was not listening to me, I would politely ask him for his opinion. This is a strategy to get his attention without disrespecting their authority.You are already on your way home when your best friend, Diego, approaches you and asks for your help with his graded report tomorrow. You know that you need to go home early because of the surprise birthday party for your father but you also see the concerned look on your best friend. What will you do and what are you going to tell Diego?    First, I would check up on the time to see if I have extra time before the party starts. If I have enough time, I would help Diego with his report. However, if there wasn't enough time before the party, I would ask Diego if I can just help him after the party. If he tells me that he's not available after the party, then I would help him find someone to help him with the project instead. I would've asked him to come over at the party, so that we can do it there, but I would not risk it since it would be disrespectful to my family.​</a>

Of course, they are, but they are also much more. Lewis Carroll had a great talent of intertwining nonsense and logic, and therefore creating sense within nonsense.

                            19.  _Express your own beliefs or opinions_ _on the following and conclude them_ _using any of these expressions. Write_ _your answers on a separate sheet of_ paper. _                        For the reasons above                     As you can see               On the whole            As I have noted          In other words 1. War is necessary for humanity to evolve and progress in the world we live today. 2. War is waged because of different religions, beliefs, and ways of life. 3. To gain peace, humankind must accept the pain that war brings. 4. War is unnecessary. Peace and goodwill are what the world needs. 5. Violence is needed to bring peace.plsss help i need it now plssssss ​</h2><br />
                        <p> </p><p>1. Wreaking violence and havoc across nations by means of war does not help himanity evolve in any way shape or form. It only hurts both sides, as seen in our history that has left significant marks by wounding our people, their homes, their culture and many more. For the reasons above, war is absolutely unecessary and humanity as a whole can evolve without warand can be achieved though peace. </p><p></p><p>2. As I have noted, war is NOT only waged in religious beliefs, idealogies and ways of life but can be one of the reasons as to why. Wars can start because of political issues and misunderstandings from the people of the government and also by it's people. </p><p></p><p>3. Peace is gained through understanding and sympathy for one another. On the whole, I am all for peace. Violence only brings pain, and it does not solve any problem but further spurs it to continue and cause more chaos. </p><p></p><p>4. By understanding one another, there is no need for wars to occur. Although it cannot be helped that there will always be an opposition that will be against or have different opinions from us, but anything can be solved by communicating with one another. As you can see, communication is the key to any relationship. Whether it is as a family, friends, or something else - by communicating, we can have an insight as to why they think a certain way and provide a gateway to help both parties to understad one another. </p><p></p><p>5. Violence will never solve a problem. It only ever brings loss, pain, wrath and propongs the issue rather than solving it. Hurting another living being is not the solution to end an ongoing dilemma. In ther words, violence is not the answer. </p><p></p><p><strong>I</strong><strong> </strong><strong>t</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>d</strong><strong> </strong><strong>m</strong><strong>y</strong><strong> </strong><strong>b</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>t</strong><strong> </strong><strong>a</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>w</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>g</strong><strong> </strong><strong>t</strong><strong>h</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>P</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>e</strong><strong> </strong><strong>r</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>v</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>e</strong><strong> </strong><strong>i</strong><strong>t</strong><strong> </strong><strong>i</strong><strong>f</strong><strong> </strong><strong>n</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>d</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>d</strong><strong> </strong><strong>h</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>h</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>s</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>m</strong><strong>e</strong><strong> </strong><strong>s</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>c</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>s</strong><strong> </strong><strong>a</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>e</strong><strong> </strong><strong>a</strong><strong> </strong><strong>b</strong><strong>u</strong><strong>t</strong><strong> </strong><strong>u</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>c</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>r</strong><strong> </strong><strong>f</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>r</strong><strong> </strong><strong>m</strong><strong>e</strong><strong> </strong><strong>s</strong><strong>o</strong><strong> </strong><strong>i</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>'</strong><strong>s</strong><strong> </strong><strong>a</strong><strong>d</strong><strong>v</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>b</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>e</strong><strong> </strong><strong>t</strong><strong>h</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>t</strong><strong> </strong><strong>y</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>u</strong><strong> </strong><strong>s</strong><strong>h</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>u</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>d</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong></p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><br />

                            20. You were not able to prepare for your graded report in Oral Communication. Mr. Reyes, then calls you to go to the front and start your presentation. How are you going to explain your situation yo your teacher?    In this situation, the first thing I would do is to admit that I was not able to prepare for the presentation and explain why. After I finish explaining to Mr. Reyes the reason why I was unprepared, I would then gladly accept the mistake I made and face all the consequences that will come with it. Once I've come to terms with my mistake, I would then apologize to Mr. Reyes for the mishap I have caused. Then, I would ask him if I can redo, the presentation, and do anything to get the grade, if I were given the chance.Your cousin, Karl, calls you over the phone and tells you that he cannot help you in your errand because he needs to do something for his school project. What will you tell him to convince him to spare you a bit of his time and that you need him to buy the surprise birthday gift for your father?    I would politely ask Karl again if he can help me with my errand. I would tell him that I would help him with his school project after we finish the errand. I would also tell him that sparing a bit of his time is already a big help and that I'd appreciate it if he helps me. Once he agrees, I would also promise him that he can also call me when he needs help on another errand.You are about to start with your report which you have failed to prepare for when your mother calls you on your mobile phone. How are you going to respond to your mother? What will you tell her?    I would answer the call first to check with my mother if it was an urgent call. If she tells me that it wasn't urgent, then I would politely ask my mother to wait for me to call her back, as I am about to do a presentation. However, if the call was urgent, I would first ask my teacher if I can spare a few minutes for my mother. If the teacher does not approve, then I will just try to listen to her on speaker phone as I do my presentation.You are in the middle of your discussion about the Tree-Planting Initiative of your school but you noticed that the District Supervisor is not really paying attention to what you are saying. How will you address the Supervisor respectfully?    If I saw the supervisor was not listening to me, I would politely ask him for his opinion. This is a strategy to get his attention without disrespecting their authority.You are already on your way home when your best friend, Diego, approaches you and asks for your help with his graded report tomorrow. You know that you need to go home early because of the surprise birthday party for your father but you also see the concerned look on your best friend. What will you do and what are you going to tell Diego?    First, I would check up on the time to see if I have extra time before the party starts. If I have enough time, I would help Diego with his report. However, if there wasn't enough time before the party, I would ask Diego if I can just help him after the party. If he tells me that he's not available after the party, then I would help him find someone to help him with the project instead. I would've asked him to come over at the party, so that we can do it there, but I would not risk it since it would be disrespectful to my family.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.) I will explain the situation politely. I will state all the resonable reasons why i wasn't able to prepare my report.
