I just can’t help myself but to share to you a very beautiful
encounter I personally witnessed as I go to work.
You know, I have read a lot of posts in social media about cops
who become abusive of their power. One video that I watched
shows police brutality towards a bystander who allegedly
violated a protocol in this time of the pandemic. For not wearing
a mask, he was immediately detained. Others raged and asked
‘Could he be just fined?’ There was another
post about a ‘ginang’ who was accordingly detained after
having argued with a policeman. And many awkward and
untoward stories continue to surface that painted a bad image to our policemen.
I do not say that these stories are not true. But what I am pointing out here is
the fact that while some other policemen seem bad and abusive, majority of them
are not and are still working under their oath, that is to protect people from crimes.
One of the many good policemen happened to be the character of this good
encounter of mine.
I was on my way to work. It was difficult for me to flag down a taxi since it was
raining on that morning. I tried several times but the cabs could not just see me for
that part of the waiting shed was hidden by some trees plus the bad weather fog
seemed to darken that street. One, two, three, four times that I tried but still I could
not take one. I would be terribly late.
I was already hopeless when suddenly a police mobile came out from nowhere
and stopped at the side of the street. A man in uniform then came out from the car. I
guessed he was at his mid-40s.He had no umbrella but thank God the rain on that
moment wasn’t that hard to bathe him soon. He smiled at me and when he noticed
that a taxi was approaching, he made a sign for it to stop. It stopped. But what
surprised me and I didn’t expect more is when he took off his uniform and enveloped
me with it. So, I didn’t get moistened by rain as I got inside the cab. I thanked him for
his kindness and secretly read the name on his plate. ‘Macapagal, L.M.’ was
engraved on it. He nodded at me and assured that I owe nothing for his kindness.
He waved then as the car began to run. I will not forget that act of kindness.
When I reached home, I overheard our maids in the kitchen gigglingly talked
about a man who helped them carry their groceries after being stuck in the rain this
afternoon. According to Aling Carmen, our old maid, she would not surely forget the
name of that police guy for the rest of her life. As it was her first to receive such
kindness from a man of her dreams. But Aling Tessie, our jolly cook, teased Aling
Carmen that the police guy was only meant for herself and not for Aling Carmen.
And both of them giggled even more. When I asked them who this ‘knight with a
shining armor’ is they were talking about, both of them screamed ‘Macapagal, L.M!’
So, you see, it was the same guy who helped me earlier. Wow! It was just natural for that police guy to help! May many beautiful encounters continue to spread down the street!

Tribute to the People's Princess and Queen of Hearts
By Christopher Anderson
Radio and television commentators agree that no single event in history had ever been witnessed by so
many people at one time. An audience of more than 2.5 billion across the globe watched the solemn
progress of Diana’s body. Behind her carriage marched Prince Philip, Earl Spencer, Charles, Princes
William and Harry. Behind the royal princess walked five representatives from each of the 110 charities
the Princess had supported: some hobbling on crutches, others from her royal wheelchair brigade.
These were her people who never thought they would be marching in a royal procession.
According to Christopher Anderson, Princess Diana's biographer the procession itself evoked bittersweet
memories of her wedding sixteen years earlier, when the world watched the radiant young Princess and
her dashing new husband waving from their glittering carriage like the characters in a fairy tale. Now
letters scrawled on a pink ballet slipper tied to the gold-filigreed gates of Kensington Palace captured
the moment. You were Cinderella at the ball, and now you are Sleeping Beauty."
Two thousand mourners inside the Abbey ran the gamut from film, rock, and fashion stars to world
leaders, cancer survivors, battered women, and land mine victims. (Singer/Songwriter) Elton John's
heartfelt tribute to his friend, "Candle in the Wind 1997," reduced the mourners, including Prince Harry,
to tears and quickly became the biggest-selling single of all time. In his moving and pointed provocative
tribute to his sister, Earl Spencer renewed his attack on the press. "I don't think she ever understood
why her genuinely good intentions were sneered at by the media, why there appeared to be a
permanent quest on their behalf to bring her down. My own and only explanation is that genuine
goodness is threatening to those at the opposite end of the moral spectrum. It is a point to remember
that all of the ironies about Diana, perhaps the greatest was this-a girl given the name of the ancient
goddess of hunting was, in the end, the most hunted person of the modern age. Also, there is no need
to canonize her because to do so would be to miss out on the very core of her being... For all the status,
the glamor, the applause, Diana remained throughout a very insecure person at heart, almost childlike
in her desire to do good for others so she could release herself from a deep feeling of unworthiness.
Then Diana's brother flung down the gauntlet before the House of Windsor itself. With Queen Victoria
seated a few yards away, he praised Diana as the very essence of compassion, duty, style, and beauty.
Someone with a natural nobility who was classless and who needed no royal title to continue to
generate her particular brand of magic. Prince Charles went ashen when the Earl pledged to Diana You
sent condition in the name of the Spencers that "we, your blood family, will do all we can to continue
the imaginative way in which you were steering your two exceptional young sons so that their souls are
no simply immersed by duty and tradition but can sing openly as you planned."
The Queen Mother looked startled, Hillary Clinton gasped audibly but the Queen, staring ahead at the
coffin, remained as inscrutable as ever. Prince Charles, whose own deeply felt grief over Diana's death
surprised even him, beat his fist against his knee.
Finally Earl Spencer's voice cracked with emotion as he thanked God "For the small mercies he has
shown us at this dreadful time. For taking Diana at her most beautiful and radiant moment and when
she had joy in her private life. Above all, we give thanks for the life of. . . the unique, the complex, the

I just can’t help myself but to share to you a very beautiful
encounter I personally witnessed as I go to work.
You know, I have read a lot of posts in social media about cops
who become abusive of their power. One video that I watched
shows police brutality towards a bystander who allegedly
violated a protocol in this time of the pandemic. For not wearing
a mask, he was immediately detained. Others raged and asked
‘Could he be just fined?’ There was another
post about a ‘ginang’ who was accordingly detained after
having argued with a policeman. And many awkward and
untoward stories continue to surface that painted a bad image to our policemen.
I do not say that these stories are not true. But what I am pointing out here is
the fact that while some other policemen seem bad and abusive, majority of them
are not and are still working under their oath, that is to protect people from crimes.
One of the many good policemen happened to be the character of this good
encounter of mine.
I was on my way to work. It was difficult for me to flag down a taxi since it was
raining on that morning. I tried several times but the cabs could not just see me for
that part of the waiting shed was hidden by some trees plus the bad weather fog
seemed to darken that street. One, two, three, four times that I tried but still I could
not take one. I would be terribly late.
I was already hopeless when suddenly a police mobile came out from nowhere
and stopped at the side of the street. A man in uniform then came out from the car. I
guessed he was at his mid-40s.He had no umbrella but thank God the rain on that
moment wasn’t that hard to bathe him soon. He smiled at me and when he noticed
that a taxi was approaching, he made a sign for it to stop. It stopped. But what
surprised me and I didn’t expect more is when he took off his uniform and enveloped
me with it. So, I didn’t get moistened by rain as I got inside the cab. I thanked him for
his kindness and secretly read the name on his plate. ‘Macapagal, L.M.’ was
engraved on it. He nodded at me and assured that I owe nothing for his kindness.
He waved then as the car began to run. I will not forget that act of kindness.
When I reached home, I overheard our maids in the kitchen gigglingly talked
about a man who helped them carry their groceries after being stuck in the rain this
afternoon. According to Aling Carmen, our old maid, she would not surely forget the
name of that police guy for the rest of her life. As it was her first to receive such
kindness from a man of her dreams. But Aling Tessie, our jolly cook, teased Aling
Carmen that the police guy was only meant for herself and not for Aling Carmen.
And both of them giggled even more. When I asked them who this ‘knight with a
shining armor’ is they were talking about, both of them screamed ‘Macapagal, L.M!’
So, you see, it was the same guy who helped me earlier. Wow! It was just natural for that police guy to help! May many beautiful encounters continue to spread down the street!

Tribute to the People's Princess and Queen of Hearts
By Christopher Anderson
Radio and television commentators agree that no single event in history had ever been witnessed by so
many people at one time. An audience of more than 2.5 billion across the globe watched the solemn
progress of Diana’s body. Behind her carriage marched Prince Philip, Earl Spencer, Charles, Princes
William and Harry. Behind the royal princess walked five representatives from each of the 110 charities
the Princess had supported: some hobbling on crutches, others from her royal wheelchair brigade.
These were her people who never thought they would be marching in a royal procession.
According to Christopher Anderson, Princess Diana's biographer the procession itself evoked bittersweet
memories of her wedding sixteen years earlier, when the world watched the radiant young Princess and
her dashing new husband waving from their glittering carriage like the characters in a fairy tale. Now
letters scrawled on a pink ballet slipper tied to the gold-filigreed gates of Kensington Palace captured
the moment. You were Cinderella at the ball, and now you are Sleeping Beauty."
Two thousand mourners inside the Abbey ran the gamut from film, rock, and fashion stars to world
leaders, cancer survivors, battered women, and land mine victims. (Singer/Songwriter) Elton John's
heartfelt tribute to his friend, "Candle in the Wind 1997," reduced the mourners, including Prince Harry,
to tears and quickly became the biggest-selling single of all time. In his moving and pointed provocative
tribute to his sister, Earl Spencer renewed his attack on the press. "I don't think she ever understood
why her genuinely good intentions were sneered at by the media, why there appeared to be a
permanent quest on their behalf to bring her down. My own and only explanation is that genuine
goodness is threatening to those at the opposite end of the moral spectrum. It is a point to remember
that all of the ironies about Diana, perhaps the greatest was this-a girl given the name of the ancient
goddess of hunting was, in the end, the most hunted person of the modern age. Also, there is no need
to canonize her because to do so would be to miss out on the very core of her being... For all the status,
the glamor, the applause, Diana remained throughout a very insecure person at heart, almost childlike
in her desire to do good for others so she could release herself from a deep feeling of unworthiness.
Then Diana's brother flung down the gauntlet before the House of Windsor itself. With Queen Victoria
seated a few yards away, he praised Diana as the very essence of compassion, duty, style, and beauty.
Someone with a natural nobility who was classless and who needed no royal title to continue to
generate her particular brand of magic. Prince Charles went ashen when the Earl pledged to Diana You
sent condition in the name of the Spencers that "we, your blood family, will do all we can to continue
the imaginative way in which you were steering your two exceptional young sons so that their souls are
no simply immersed by duty and tradition but can sing openly as you planned."
The Queen Mother looked startled, Hillary Clinton gasped audibly but the Queen, staring ahead at the
coffin, remained as inscrutable as ever. Prince Charles, whose own deeply felt grief over Diana's death
surprised even him, beat his fist against his knee.
Finally Earl Spencer's voice cracked with emotion as he thanked God "For the small mercies he has
shown us at this dreadful time. For taking Diana at her most beautiful and radiant moment and when
she had joy in her private life. Above all, we give thanks for the life of. . . the unique, the complex, the
extraordinary, and irreplaceable Diana-whose beauty, both internal and external, will never be
extinguished from our minds.
