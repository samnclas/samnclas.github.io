Adolf Hitler, a German politician and leader of the Nazi party, exercised dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, and a strong regimentation of society and the economy, emerged dramatically in Europe particularly in Germany. 4.

Adolf Hitler, a German politician and leader of the Nazi party, exercised dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, and a strong regimentation of society and the economy, emerged dramatically in Europe particularly in Germany. 4.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p>Before the Spanish conquistadors came to the Philippines, the Filipinos had their own laws and system of administering justice. The government was patriarchal in form. The unit of government was the barangay, a settlement of about 30 to 100 families. The barangays were independent of each other.During Pre-Hispanic times Filipinos can be divided according to these classes: The noble class called the Maginoo; the freeman class called the Timawa; the warrior class called the Maharlika; and the indentured class called the Alipin.During the pre-Spanish era, law was laid down by the mahar- likas -council of elders, but chosen by the datu, no elections were held to designate them.Some of the indigenous people mixed with the Spanish, some were overwhelmed by them. Both groups adopted Catholicism. Other groups like the Igorot resisted. The Spanish burned Igorot villages, destroyed their crops and raped their women, yet in 350 years of Spanish occupation the Igorot were never conquered.United States improved the economy and system of government, where the Filipinos had greater political participation and more economic gains. The American rule caused great marks of “colonial mentality” and the materialistic and individualistic ways among many Filipinos.<br />
