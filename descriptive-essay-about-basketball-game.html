I prefer indoors, although it can be played outdoors, and some even prefer it that way.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Filipino food is a mixture of sweet, salty, and sour flavours. Rice figures heavily — this is Southeast Asia, after all! — and coconut is of utmost importance, with all parts of the coconut (including the sap and leaves) used in cooking and preparation. </p><p>2. Traditional games are seen as the best platform for "promoting peace, harmony, goodwill and camaraderie" in various Philippine communities especially that today's generation is different, most kids are stuck on their phones, iPods, and PSPs while sitting on a corner. </p><p>3. The Filipino culture is an exuberant story that tells of the nation's journey through the centuries. Customs reflect the people's faith, their oneness with others, their affinity with nature, and their celebration of life.</p><p></p><p>The Filipino's charm lies in their smiles, in the numerous religious festivals that venerate nature, the Divine and the cycles of life and in the virtue of pakikipag-kapwa tao that treasures relationships, with friends and strangers alike.

One player from either team try to get their hands on the ball and the ball is passed on to the teammates. For scoring a point, a team needs to shoot the ball through the basket. If a shot is scored from a distance that is closer to the basket than the 3 point line than it fetches 2 points. Also, if the ball is shot from the distance behind 3 point line, it fetches 3 points.

He was going to use a slightly large and light ball. Since the game was made to play indoors the players would have no need to run with the ball. Also players couldn’t hit or strike other players. After Naismith came up with the basic rules he decided what the goal of the game would be. The goals were first going to be placed low but Naismith decided that if the other team were defending it, it would be nearly impossible to make a goal. This is how the idea of the basketball hoop came about. He decided to place the goal over the player’s heads. The goals would start as peach baskets but would later evolve into hoops (Padwe). The hoops would be made of iron and a braided cord netting to verify the ball was going through the hoop (Peterson).	 Naismith had his game ready but needed a way to start it. He thought of several different ways but wanted to eliminate roughness. He decided to take part of rugby when the ref throws the ball in between the players. Naismith said the ball would be thrown in an upward motion in between both of the centers for each team and this would be the start of the game. The game of basketball was now ready but just needed people to start it.

                        Pandemic (Descriptive Essay):<p></p><p>The pandemic that rocked the world in the year 2020 will be remembered as one of the most challenging periods in human history. It started as a small outbreak in Wuhan, China and quickly spread to different parts of the world, resulting in mass infections and fatalities. The pandemic forced governments to declare nationwide lockdowns, causing disruptions in all aspects of life, including the economy, social life, and education.</p><p></p><p>The pandemic changed people’s daily lives in unprecedented ways. People were forced to wear masks and keep social distancing measures. Suddenly, the routine activities people took for granted, such as going to the office, attending classes, traveling, and socializing with friends, were threatened, if not entirely impossible. The pandemic cast a shadow of fear and uncertainty over everyone, causing panic and anxiety.</p><p></p><p>As schools and businesses were forced to shut down, people had to adapt to new ways of learning and working. Virtual communication became the norm, with video conferencing and online communication platforms taking the place of face-to-face interactions. However, this led to new challenges, such as internet connectivity issues and privacy concerns.</p><p></p><p>The pandemic also had significant economic impacts, with several businesses and industries grinding to a halt, resulting in layoffs and unemployment. Some small businesses closed their doors entirely, making it difficult for many people to keep their livelihoods. While some people could work remotely, others had to take up essential roles, such as doctors, nurses, and first responders, exposing themselves to the virus and risking their lives to keep others safe.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the pandemic presented significant challenges on a global scale. While the world is still grappling with the effects of the virus, the pandemic has taught us to prioritize our health and rethink our approaches to work, education, and socialization. Although it was a difficult time, it also brought people closer, and we saw communities coming together to support each other.</p><p></p><p><strong>Please </strong><strong>trust </strong><strong>me,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>I </strong><strong>haven’</strong><strong>t</strong><strong> </strong><strong>copy </strong><strong>on </strong><strong>Google,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>I </strong><strong>just </strong><strong>answer </strong><strong>it </strong><strong>in </strong><strong>my </strong><strong>own.</strong></p><p>In the 21st century, it seems like the world is constantly on edge, waiting for the next disaster to strike. From natural disasters like earthquakes and hurricanes to human-made crises like wars and political uprisings, the world has seen it all. Yet there is one crisis that has transcended all others in its global reach and long-lasting effects: the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p></p><p></p><p>It all began in late 2019, when the mysterious and highly infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus was identified in China. At first, it seemed like an isolated outbreak that would be quickly contained and disappear into the fringes of history. But within a few weeks, it became clear that this was no ordinary epidemic. As the virus spread across the globe, it infected millions of people, overwhelming healthcare systems and leaving many countries desperately scrambling to find a way to stop the spread.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In the early days of the pandemic, there was a sense of disbelief and fear. People were unsure about what this new virus could do, and there were many questions that remained unanswered. Scientists worked tirelessly to learn more about the virus and develop treatments and vaccines, but the uncertainty and fear of the unknown remained.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Despite the best efforts of healthcare professionals and governments, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on people and communities across the world. It has claimed the lives of millions of people, and many more have suffered from long-term health effects. The pandemic has also had a significant impact on the global economy, with many businesses forced to close their doors and millions of people becoming unemployed or under-employed.</p><p></p><p></p><p>But even in the darkest days of the pandemic, there was a sense of hope. As scientists worked on developing vaccines, it became clear that there was a light at the end of the tunnel. And when the first effective vaccines became available, it was like a beacon of hope for the world.</p><p></p><p></p><p>As the pandemic continues to evolve, it is clear that the world will never be the same. The COVID-19 virus has left an indelible mark on humanity and has changed the way we live and work. But even in the midst of this crisis, there have been heroes who have risen up to face the challenge and have given us hope for a better future.<br /><strong><br /><br /><br />Happy learning!

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Originally, the game was played with peach baskets or 18” square boxes hung from the balconies of the running tracks of most indoor facilities.</p><p> </p><p>Obviously, the peach baskets and boxes slowed the game down since the ball had to be retrieved after every goal either by someone on the running track or by ladder. </p><p></p><p>This was a major milestone for basketball since the free falling ball after a made basket dramatically increased tempo and scoring of the game.</p><br />
