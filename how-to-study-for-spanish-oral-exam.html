                            3. 1. 105 adults were asked whether they had studied French, Spanish, or Japanese in school. Here are the results of the survey:5 are taking all three9 have studied both Japanese and French11 have studied both Japanese and Spanish24 have studied both Spanish and French52 have studied French63 have studied Spanish25 have studied Japanesequestions:a. Create a Venn diagram to model the informationb. How many have studied Spanish but not French?c. How many have studied Japanese but not French?d. How many have studied both Spanish and French? e.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>high in the given problem, we can write that the J intersection F intersection as is equal to five and jay intersection F. Is equal to nine. J intersection S. is equal to 11, and S intersection F. is equal to 24 And f is equal to 52 as is Equal to 63 and J is equal to 25. Where J. S. F. R. The set of students who have studied Japanese, spanish and french respectively. Now the now we have the number of students who have studied both french and spanish as So part of the question. We have to find f intersection s. And that is equal to 24. So that's the answer for the first part. The next part we are required to find the number of students that have studied french or spanish. So we have to find F unionist. So that is equal to F plus as minus F intersection S. And when we put the value we have 52 plus 63 minus 24. And that comes out to be 91. So that's the answer for the second part, 91 part C. We have to find the number of students that studied french spanish but not japanese. So we have to find S. Union F. Union J minus J. So that is equal to X plus ah J plus F. S plus C plus f minus s, intersection, J minus s intersection, F minus f, intersection J. And plus S intersection J intersection F minus J. So when we put these values, we get this as 52 plus 63 plus 25 minus 24 minus 11 minus nine plus five minus 25. And this comes out to be 76. So that's the answer for the third part, and that's the complete solution.
