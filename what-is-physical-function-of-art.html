                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The most common functional art takes the form of timepieces of some kind—sundials, water clocks, etc. Personally, I draw a distinction between design, a piece that is reproduced several times to fulfill a function e.g. door handles, hinges, etc., and functional art, that which was created once with the aesthetic taking center stage.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

3. REFLECT: WHAT IS THE PHYSICAL FUNCTION OF ART?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Design helps us get involved, keeps us connected to the world, helps us navigate our way through physical and digital spaces. It has the power to persuade and strengthen the decision-making process. Wherever we encounter the language in written form, we see the work of font designers and typographers.</p><p>2.Early Islamic architecture was influenced by Roman, Byzantine, Persian</p><p>3.Physical. The physical functions of art are often the easiest to understand. Works of art that are created to perform some service have physical functions. If you see a Fijian war club, you may assume that, however wonderful the craftsmanship may be, it was created to perform the physical function of smashing skulls.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope is correct^^</p><br />
