If there is NO topic and concluding sentence, write NONE. 1.Driving under the alcohol influence isn’t a good practice for professional drivers. Nowadays, professional drivers who always find themselves partying till midnight will drive home drunk. Because they are very eager to go home, they will insist that they can drive. After some moments of driving, they will feel sleepy and eventually, they will be vulnerable to accidents and worse, even death. Therefore, it may be a cliché to say but still it is better not to drink and drive! 2.“It’s summertime! No doubt, people are dreaming of the ideal vacation: walking leisurely along the beach, or filling one’s lungs with fresh mountain air; waking up in the morning without being harassed by a list of things to do, or whiling away the hours without guilt or regret. For those with money to spend, the ideal vacation means endless shopping, touring, or partying. For people who are cash-strapped, vacation means staying at home, relishing the company of loved ones, watching TV, reading a book, or rearranging the furniture. For those bent on improving spiritual life, vacation means the time for retreats, recollections, or more intense personal prayers.” 3. Are you in love? Don’t have enough confidence to tell your feelings to someone special to you? Want to say sorry? Just want to request a song? Want to say thank you? Or you just want to say hello to your friends? Well, that is not a problem. Speaker’s bureau dedication booth is here. Let your message accompanied with your favorite song be heard dedicated to your special someone! 4.“I recall that even before I learned how to write my name, I was already into drawing. First, my mother would tell me that she doesn’t know how I learned to draw, every time I ask her. But she remembers that my joy then was to scribble anything that would smear itself on any surface. That meant pencils, chalks, pen, crayons, coloring pencils, even adobe stones and charcoals. Second, I remember too that every time I used these instruments on the wall, paper, floor, fence or pavement, I would always be stopped, scolded, spanked, reprimanded or at the very least, cautioned. But I did really love to see those smear tools do their dirtying job under the whim and every movement of my hand. That, I called drawing.” ​​</a>

                                            A team at the Natural History Museum (NHM), London is paving the way for future rovers to search for meteorites on Mars. The scientists are using the NHM's extensive meteorite collection to test the spectral instruments destined for the ExoMars rover Rosalind Franklin, and develop tools to identify meteorites on the surface of the red planet. The project is being presented today (23 July) at the virtual National Astronomy Meeting 2021.The cratered surface of our nearest planetary neighbor has a long and complex history, and searching for rocks amidst more rocks may seem like a futile activity. Despite this, Martian rovers statistically have a significantly higher 'find per mile' success rate than dedicated meteorite hunts on Earth: for every kilometer travelled by a Mars rover, approximately one meteorite is found, even though the rovers have not been specifically looking for them up till now.However, as part of the European Space Agency's upcoming ExoMars mission, the next rover -- named Rosalind Franklin, after the chemist best known for her pioneering work on DNA -- will drill down into the Martian surface to sample the soil, analyze its composition and search for evidence of past or present life buried underground.Meteorites are important pieces of evidence that can help us understand this story; once a meteorite lands on a planet, it is subjected to the same atmospheric conditions as the rest of the surface. Chemical and physical weathering can provide information on climate weathering rates and water-rock interactions, meteorite sizes and distribution can help to infer information about the density of the atmosphere, and stony meteorites could be a potential delivery mechanism for organic materials to Mars."Meteorites act as a witness plate across geological time," said Sara Motaghian, the PhD student at the NHM and Imperial College London who is carrying out the work. "Generally, the surfaces of Mars we are exploring are incredibly ancient, meaning there have been billions of years for the surface to accumulate these meteorites and lock in information from across Mars' past."The team are looking in particular at the use of multispectral imaging with the PanCam instrument, hoping to be able to highlight features in images that could be associated with meteorites as the rover moves across the surface. They are also investigating the possibility of using pattern recognition techniques to distinguish features such as Widmanstätten patterns, which can be revealed by extreme weathering.The launch of the ExoMars rover was originally scheduled for 2020, however was delayed until 2022 due to technical issues and growing concerns over the coronavirus pandemic. Once the rover reaches Mars in 2023, the team hope that their work will allow meteorites on the surface to be studied for longer by the Rosalind Franklin rover before it drives on, helping to build a more complete understanding of the Martian surface and its history, if any, of life.​</a>

If there is NO topic and concluding sentence, write NONE. 1.Driving under the alcohol influence isn’t a good practice for professional drivers. Nowadays, professional drivers who always find themselves partying till midnight will drive home drunk. Because they are very eager to go home, they will insist that they can drive. After some moments of driving, they will feel sleepy and eventually, they will be vulnerable to accidents and worse, even death. Therefore, it may be a cliché to say but still it is better not to drink and drive! 2.“It’s summertime! No doubt, people are dreaming of the ideal vacation: walking leisurely along the beach, or filling one’s lungs with fresh mountain air; waking up in the morning without being harassed by a list of things to do, or whiling away the hours without guilt or regret. For those with money to spend, the ideal vacation means endless shopping, touring, or partying. For people who are cash-strapped, vacation means staying at home, relishing the company of loved ones, watching TV, reading a book, or rearranging the furniture. For those bent on improving spiritual life, vacation means the time for retreats, recollections, or more intense personal prayers.” 3. Are you in love?

Let your message accompanied with your favorite song be heard dedicated to your special someone! 4.“I recall that even before I learned how to write my name, I was already into drawing. First, my mother would tell me that she doesn’t know how I learned to draw, every time I ask her. But she remembers that my joy then was to scribble anything that would smear itself on any surface. That meant pencils, chalks, pen, crayons, coloring pencils, even adobe stones and charcoals. Second, I remember too that every time I used these instruments on the wall, paper, floor, fence or pavement, I would always be stopped, scolded, spanked, reprimanded or at the very least, cautioned. But I did really love to see those smear tools do their dirtying job under the whim and every movement of my hand. That, I called drawing.” ​​</h2><br />

                            17. A team at the Natural History Museum (NHM), London is paving the way for future rovers to search for meteorites on Mars. The scientists are using the NHM's extensive meteorite collection to test the spectral instruments destined for the ExoMars rover Rosalind Franklin, and develop tools to identify meteorites on the surface of the red planet. The project is being presented today (23 July) at the virtual National Astronomy Meeting 2021.The cratered surface of our nearest planetary neighbor has a long and complex history, and searching for rocks amidst more rocks may seem like a futile activity. Despite this, Martian rovers statistically have a significantly higher 'find per mile' success rate than dedicated meteorite hunts on Earth: for every kilometer travelled by a Mars rover, approximately one meteorite is found, even though the rovers have not been specifically looking for them up till now.However, as part of the European Space Agency's upcoming ExoMars mission, the next rover -- named Rosalind Franklin, after the chemist best known for her pioneering work on DNA -- will drill down into the Martian surface to sample the soil, analyze its composition and search for evidence of past or present life buried underground.Meteorites are important pieces of evidence that can help us understand this story; once a meteorite lands on a planet, it is subjected to the same atmospheric conditions as the rest of the surface. Chemical and physical weathering can provide information on climate weathering rates and water-rock interactions, meteorite sizes and distribution can help to infer information about the density of the atmosphere, and stony meteorites could be a potential delivery mechanism for organic materials to Mars."Meteorites act as a witness plate across geological time," said Sara Motaghian, the PhD student at the NHM and Imperial College London who is carrying out the work. "Generally, the surfaces of Mars we are exploring are incredibly ancient, meaning there have been billions of years for the surface to accumulate these meteorites and lock in information from across Mars' past."The team are looking in particular at the use of multispectral imaging with the PanCam instrument, hoping to be able to highlight features in images that could be associated with meteorites as the rover moves across the surface. They are also investigating the possibility of using pattern recognition techniques to distinguish features such as Widmanstätten patterns, which can be revealed by extreme weathering.The launch of the ExoMars rover was originally scheduled for 2020, however was delayed until 2022 due to technical issues and growing concerns over the coronavirus pandemic. Once the rover reaches Mars in 2023, the team hope that their work will allow meteorites on the surface to be studied for longer by the Rosalind Franklin rover before it drives on, helping to build a more complete understanding of the Martian surface and its history, if any, of life.​</h2><br />
