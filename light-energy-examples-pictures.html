                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> Energy can change from one form to another. For example, when you switch on a lightbulb, electrical energy changes to thermal energy and light energy. A car changes energy stored in the chemical bonds of gasoline to several different forms. A chemical reaction in the engine changes chemical energy to light ...</p><p></p><p>Objective: Heat</p><p></p><p>Heat energy, also referred to as thermal energy, is really the effect of moving molecules. Matter is made up of molecules, which are in continual motion and in a solid, vibrate about a mean position. The motion of any molecule increases when the energy of the substance is increased. This may cause an increase in the temperature of the substance or lead to a change of state. The higher the temperature, the greater the internal energy of the substance.</p><p></p><p>Heat energy is the most easily lost or dissipated form of energy. It is also the form of energy into which other forms of energy can easily change. However, heat can be changed into other forms of energy with a lot of waste.also called Solar Energy</p><p></p><p>Light</p><p></p><p>Light energy is a type of wave motion. That is, light is a form of energy caused by light waves. It enables us to see, as objects are only visible when they reflect light into our eyes.</p><p></p><p>Sound</p><p></p><p>Sound energy is also a type of wave motion. We are heard by others when we talk because of the sound energy we produce. It is due to the effect of the air molecules vibrating when we talk. The vibrating molecules hit our eardrums, which enable us to hear others talk. Sound energy may be converted into electrical energy for transmission, and later the electrical energy can be converted back into sound energy at the receiving end. An example of such transformations could be seen in the microphone and the loudspeaker.</p><p></p><p>Sound, like heat energy is easily lost. The transformation of one form of energy into another may be accompanied by losses in the form of sound and/or heat that are often not desirable.</p><p></p><p>Electrical Energy</p><p></p><p>Electrical energy is really the effect of moving electrical charges from one point to another in a conductor. Electrical charges moving through a conductor is called electricity. Electrical energy may be easily changed into other forms of energy to suit our particular needs. Lightning is an example of electrical energy. Electric current is the means by which electrical energy is most easily transported to places where it is needed and converted into other forms.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
