My father had, besides his salary, a two-hectare rice-land which he cultivated. While I was a boy and during my early youth, my father saved as much as he could from his meager salary and from what he could get from his rice-field, only to have a few hundred pesos with which to give me an education. During those Spanish days, a Filipino family could live in a small town on four pesos a month and a supply of rice. Thus, did my family live for years. When I was at the age of five, an aunt of mine started to teach me to read and write. My own father and mother, and the priest of the town later gave me my primary instruction. At the age of nine, I was brought by my father to Manila and began my secondary education at San Juan de Letran College. First, I lived in the Convent of San Francisco serving as a coom-and-mess boy for one priest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my father moved me to the house of an aunt where for some pesos. I roomed and boarded. The house was located in Paco, too far from the Walled City for him who could only use his own feet as a means of transportation. My classes started at seven o'clock in the morning and I had to get up very early to reach my classes on time. Again, this impaired my health, and the following year, I was taken by my father to San Juan de Letran as an intern. I remained as an intern until I graduated as A.B. with the highest honors. By this time, the savings of my father bad all been spent on my education. He owed money, and simply told me that I had to stop my studies unless I could work my way through university education. I came to Manila and spoke to my Dominican professors, who, by this time, had become very fond of me, and told them of my situation. I wanted to be a lawyer, but could not pay for my expenses. They secured a position for me as one of the helpers in the University of Santo Tomas with room and board and free tuition.

Then, answer the questions that follow. Do this in your notebook. "I was born a poor man, the son of a school teacher in one of the smallest towns in the Philippines-Baler. My father had, besides his salary, a two-hectare rice-land which he cultivated. While I was a boy and during my early youth, my father saved as much as he could from his meager salary and from what he could get from his rice-field, only to have a few hundred pesos with which to give me an education. During those Spanish days, a Filipino family could live in a small town on four pesos a month and a supply of rice. Thus, did my family live for years. When I was at the age of five, an aunt of mine started to teach me to read and write. My own father and mother, and the priest of the town later gave me my primary instruction. At the age of nine, I was brought by my father to Manila and began my secondary education at San Juan de Letran College. First, I lived in the Convent of San Francisco serving as a room-and-mess boy for one priest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my father moved me to the house of an aunt where for some pesos, I roomed and boarded. The house was located in Paco, too far from the Walled City for him who could only use his own feet as a means of transportation. My classes started at seven o'clock in the morning and I had to get up very early to reach my classes on time. Again, this impaired my health, and the following year, I was taken by my father to San Juan de Letran as an intern. I remained as an intern until I graduated as A.B. with the highest honors. By this time, the savings of my father had all been spent on my education. He owed money, and simply told me that I had to stop my studies unless I could work my way through university education. I came to Manila and spoke to my Dominican professors, who, by this time, had become very fond of me, and told them of my situation. I wanted to be a lawyer, but could not pay for my expenses. They secured a position for me as one of the helpers in the University of Santo Tomas with room and board and free tuition. Thus, I was able to take up the study of law."

Then she added, "Stretch it on a flat stone and burn it there on a windless night." The farmer did what his mother told him, and amazingly it worked. He told the other villagers that he could make the governor's demand. Immediately, the farmer was sent to the governor's place to show him the rope of ashes.The governor become happy to see how smart his people are from accomplishing a difficult task. To his joy, he asked the farmer where he got his wisdom. This made the former tremble in fear and immediately bowed down to the governor, begging for forgiveness. The former had told him about his mother and how he was able to create the rope of ashes. The governor became silent and had thought deeply for a while. At that moment, he abolished his law on abandoning the old people. He would not kill the elders anymore because they had great wisdom.Direction: Answer the following questions.

My father had, besides his salary, a two-hectare rice-land which he cultivated. While I was a boy and during my early youth, my father saved as much as he could from his meager salary and from what he could get from his rice-field, only to have a few hundred pesos with which to give me an education. During those Spanish days, a Filipino family could live in a small town on four pesos a month and a supply of rice. Thus, did my family live for years. When I was at the age of five, an aunt of mine started to teach me to read and write. My own father and mother, and the priest of the town later gave me my primary instruction. At the age of nine, I was brought by my father to Manila and began my secondary education at the San Juan de Letran College. First, I lived in the Convent of San Francisco serving as a room-and-mess boy for one priest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my father moved me to the house of an aunt where for some pesos, I roomed and boarded. The house was located in Paco, too far from the Walled City for him who could only use his own feet as a means of transportation. My classes started at seven o'clock in the morning and I had to get up very early to reach my classes on time. Again, this impaired my health, and the following year, I was taken by my father to San Juan de Letran as an intern. I remained as an intern until I graduated as A.B. with the highest honors. By this time, the savings of my father had all been spent on my education. He owed money, and simply told me that I had to stop my studies unless I could work my way through university education. I came to Manila and spoke to my Dominican professors, who, by this time, had become very fond of me, and told them of my situation. I wanted to be a lawyer, but could not pay for my expenses. They secured a position for me as one of the helpers in the University of Santo Tomas with room and board and free tuition. Thus, I was able to take up the study of law.''1.

friendly to everyone. Age, health, race, gender, education, ethnicity and family status 
have never mattered. Recently your aunt divorced her husband due to his lengthy 
sentence given for a crime against humanity. That’s all your parents would tell you 
about this situation. Because your aunt is undergoing chemotherapy for an illness no 
one will discuss, you learn that your cousin will be coming to stay with you for at least 
half of the school year. You and your cousin are one year apart; that’s good because 
you will be able to introduce him to your friends and even double date together. As you 
prepare to share your bedroom, you tell your friends that he’s coming within the week. 
Then the doorbell rings. You are upstairs, so your mother answers the door. You can 
hear people talking in hushed tones, and occasionally words such as “AIDS, risky 
business, welfare, trashy people, divorce, communicable disease, and dirt bags” pass 
your ears. You hear the door slam as Mom’s sobs echo throughout the house. Dad is 
enraged when he comes home from work and hears what happened.  
Using  the  decision-making  process,  determine  what  you  will  do  in  an  attempt  to 
remedy this series of questionable events and save face for your family. Based on 
this scenario, students will answer the question where he/she believe the responsibility 
of the family is the greatest – to the larger society as a whole or to protect individual 
family members. Would  you feel the same if the story involved turning in a drug 
addict or an escaped felon?</a>

Then, my father moved me to the house of an aunt where for some pesos, I roomed and boarded. The house was located in Paco, too far from the Walled City for him who could only use his own feet as a means of transportation. My classes started at seven o'clock in the morning and I had to get up very early to reach my classes on time. Again, this impaired my health, and the following year, I was taken by my father to San Juan de Letran as an intern. I remained as an intern until I graduated as A.B. with the highest honors. By this time, the savings of my father had all been spent on my education. He owed money, and simply told me that I had to stop my studies unless I could work my way through university education. I came to Manila and spoke to my Dominican professors, who, by this time, had become very fond of me, and told them of my situation. I wanted to be a lawyer, but could not pay for my expenses. They secured a position for me as one of the helpers in the University of Santo Tomas with room and board and free tuition. Thus, I was able to take up the study of law."

They lived well but simply until the cruel governor declared a wicked law. He said, "I have no desire for old people in my village. They are weak and can not do work!" The law was to put the people aging 75 years and above to be abandoned in the mountain. The cruel governor also added. "All who will disobey the law must be put to death together with their old relatives." This law made the young farmer very sad for his mother was very old. Though he loved his mother, he must obey the governor. The young farmer carried his mother to the mountain with a heavy heart.On their way to the mountain, the mother dropped small twigs as markers to help her son get back When the farmer bade farewell, she advised him to return home with the aid of the twigs. This made the son make up his mind to take his mother back home. Filled with dread, he hid his mother in his home. Their kitchen, where he keeps their food, became his mother's new place to live. Time passed, and the farmer was beginning to feel safe when the governor had announced a demand to all of his people that he wanted a rope of ash. Nobody in the village could make one, it was impossible.The farmer became anxious with the governor's demand, so he asked his mother if she knew how to make one. His old mother, filled with the wisdom she gained from her years of living, had smiled to show her son that the governor's demand is not impossible. She said, "Son, make a rope from a twisted straw." Then she added, "Stretch it on a flat stone and burn it there on a windless night." The farmer did what his mother told him, and amazingly it worked. He told the other villagers that he could make the governor's demand. Immediately, the farmer was sent to the governor's place to show him the rope of ashes.The governor become happy to see how smart his people are from accomplishing a difficult task. To his joy, he asked the farmer where he got his wisdom. This made the former tremble in fear and immediately bowed down to the governor, begging for forgiveness. The former had told him about his mother and how he was able to create the rope of ashes. The governor became silent and had thought deeply for a while. At that moment, he abolished his law on abandoning the old people. He would not kill the elders anymore because they had great wisdom.Direction: Answer the following questions.

Do this in your notebook.MANUEL QUEZON "I was born a poor man, the son of a school teacher in one of the smallest towns in the Philippines–Baler. My father had, besides his salary, a two-hectare rice-land which he cultivated. While I was a boy and during my early youth, my father saved as much as he could from his meager salary and from what he could get from his rice-field, only to have a few hundred pesos with which to give me an education.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1.  President Manuel L. Quezon <strong>can indeed inspired anyone to pursue his/her dreams no matter how difficult their situation could get</strong>.  Compared to his time, we have more opportunities to live a better, more fulfilled life since we live in a freer society.  Moreover, his example as public servant can also inspired people to pay it forward and do what they can to help others.</p><p>2.  For sure, <strong>he wants to inspire the youth of his time to dream big and do what they can to chase their dreams</strong>.  From a simple family that lives on a meager four-peso monthly income, he has come a long way to becoming a leader of the republic.  His fine example has outlived many generations  and continues to inspire people at this time. <strong>He also probably wants to encourage the people to help one another </strong>which is important in uplifting their lives.</p><p>3. It can make young people <strong>rethink how important it is that to value every opportunity that they are handed right now</strong>.  It may be in the form of education which not everyone gets to have.  They better start focusing on things that matter to to them as a student, and make sure they are doing their best.  </p><p>#BRAINLYEVERYDAY</p><br />

                            23. Having lived in the city all of your life, you know people well and feel they are especially 
friendly to everyone. Age, health, race, gender, education, ethnicity and family status 
have never mattered. Recently your aunt divorced her husband due to his lengthy 
sentence given for a crime against humanity. That’s all your parents would tell you 
about this situation. Because your aunt is undergoing chemotherapy for an illness no 
one will discuss, you learn that your cousin will be coming to stay with you for at least 
half of the school year. You and your cousin are one year apart; that’s good because 
you will be able to introduce him to your friends and even double date together. As you 
prepare to share your bedroom, you tell your friends that he’s coming within the week. 
Then the doorbell rings. You are upstairs, so your mother answers the door. You can 
hear people talking in hushed tones, and occasionally words such as “AIDS, risky 
business, welfare, trashy people, divorce, communicable disease, and dirt bags” pass 
your ears. You hear the door slam as Mom’s sobs echo throughout the house. Dad is 
enraged when he comes home from work and hears what happened.  
Using  the  decision-making  process,  determine  what  you  will  do  in  an  attempt  to 
remedy this series of questionable events and save face for your family. Based on 
this scenario, students will answer the question where he/she believe the responsibility 
of the family is the greatest – to the larger society as a whole or to protect individual 
family members. Would  you feel the same if the story involved turning in a drug 
addict or an escaped felon?</h2><br />

“I was born a poor man, the son of a school teacher 
in one of the smallest towns in the Philippines—Baler. 
My father had, besides his salary, a two-hectare 
rice-land which he cultivated. While I was a boy and 
during my early youth, my father saved as much as he 
could from his meager salary and from what he could 
get from his rice-field, only to have a few hundred pesos 
with which to give me an education. During those 
Spanish days, a Filipino family could live in a small 
town on four pesos a month and a supply of rice. Thus, 
did my family live for years. When I was at the age of 
five, an aunt of mine started to teach me to read and write. My own father 
and mother, and the priest of the town later gave me my primary 
instruction. At the age of nine, I was brought by my father to Manila and 
began my secondary education at San Juan de Letran College. First, I lived 
in the Convent of San Francisco serving as a room-and-mess boy for one 
priest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my father moved 
me to the house of an aunt where for some pesos, I roomed and boarded. 
The house was located in Paco, too far from the Walled City for him who 
could only use his own feet as a means of transportation. My 
classes started at seven o’clock in the morning and I had to get up very 
early to reach my classes on time. Again, this impaired my health, and the 
following year, I was taken by my father to San Juan de Letran as an 
intern. I remained as an intern until I graduated as A.B. with the highest 
honors. By this time, the savings of my father had all been spent on my 
education. He owed money, and simply told me that I had to stop my 
studies unless I could work my way through university education. I came 
to Manila and spoke to my Dominican professors, who, by this time, had 
become very fond of me, and told them of my situation. I wanted to be a 
lawyer, but could not pay for my expenses. They secured a position for me 
as one of the helpers in the University of Santo Tomas with room and board 
and free tuition. Thus, I was able to take up the study of law.”
