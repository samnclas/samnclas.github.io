I toll all night thinking about all the questions I already got wrong and many more embarrassing “Wrong!” responses that I’ll get the next day. When my alarm does go off, I’m exhausted, and of course, by the time math class rolls around, there’s no way I can fully function. *</a>

                                            Case study 1: A co-teacher complains to you about two of her 3rd grade students diagnosed with ADHD. In a regular class of 35 students, these two boys have become too difficult to handle. They often disrupt the class with side comments or questions that are tangential to the topic. They also often move around during class discussion and work through written tasks quickly resulting in haphazard answers. The only time they are engaged is when there are hands-on activities for them to do. So, the teacher decided to sit them together in class to make it easier for her to manage them. Knowing about the profiles of children with ADHD, what practical advice can you give your co-teacher? ​</a>

This is the type of delivery used when you prepare your speech well in advance. It takes all of that research, organization, and outlining work and then uses it to WRITE OUT THE SPEECH. 2. This one is pretty straightforward. You write out your entire presentation and you read it. 3. This speech is recited from the memory. 4. This is where the speakers speaks from an outline that's researched and put together. 5. This one is a little bit like manuscript except from you literally memorized it word for word you. It is like manuscript without papers with you because you memorized it. 6. This is the most common type of delivery in college presentations. When speaking, you have meticulously researched, organized, and practiced your speech ahead of time but it SOUNDS TOTALLY NATURAL. 7. This type of speech according to delivery also has few drawbacks. Not the least of which is forgetting the speech altogether. This, also, is a type of delivery best left to professional and competitive public speakers. 8. This delivery has little or no preparation. This happens when you get called on to answer a question in a class, without the benefit of a lot of advanced planning. 9. This speech works to convince people to change in some way; they think, the way they do something, or to start doing something that they are not currently doing. 10. Pastor teaching a class about the meaning behind Holy Communion in the Christian Church. 11. The cost of forgetting an anniversary. 12. The students is sharing his worse excuse he has ever given to a teacher. 13. Should classes about mental health and wellness be added to school curriculum? 14.

                                            Two students were taking organic chemistry at the university. Having done well in their work and labs, they were both going into the final exam with solid A's. So far so good. Trouble was, they were so confident that they decided to party the night before the big test. It was a great night; one thing led to another, and they ended up sleeping late the following morning. 
They missed the exam! Disasterville! Being inventive souls, though, they went to see the professor to explain that they had been visiting a sick-out-of-town friend the night before. On the way home, they had a flat tire. With no spare tire and no car jack, they were stranded. They could only manage to hitch a lift back to town midmorning, which is why they missed the test. They were really sorry to have missed the exam, they said (they were so looking forward to it!) but wondered whether they might be able to take it that afternoon. 
The professor thought about it for a moment and decided that this would be permissible since they hadn't had time to discuss the exam with any of the students who had already taken it. After a short break for lunch, the two students were ready for the test. The professor placed them in separate rooms, handed each of them an exam booklet, and told to begin. Page one, question one. A simple one for five points. This will be easy! Having answered the first question each of the students turned the page for question number two: Which tire? (95 points).</a>

The distance learning tells us students that education is a priviledge, not a right.

In a regular class of 35 students, these two boys have become too difficult to handle. They often disrupt the class with side comments or questions that are tangential to the topic. They also often move around during class discussion and work through written tasks quickly resulting in haphazard answers. The only time they are engaged is when there are hands-on activities for them to do. So, the teacher decided to sit them together in class to make it easier for her to manage them.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Yes,Studies have shown that different fertilizer types, as well as fertilization modes and rates directly affect rice yield and quality [11–13]. </p><p>2. Why apply N FERTILIZER to rice</p><p>Nitrogen is the most limiting element in almost all soils. Thus, proper application of N fertilizers is vital to improve crop growth and grain yields, especially in intensive agricultural systems.</p><p>3.SPRING</p><p>Fertilizer is most effective when used on plants at their peak growing cycle. This is when the plant is leafing out for deciduous species, flowering, or putting on new growth after leaving the dormant winter stage. The time of year for fertilizing most plants would then be spring.</p><p></p><p>5.Water is a precious and scarce resource input in rice production, so it is very important that irrigation water is used wisely and efficiently.

This is where the speakers speaks from an outline that's researched and put together. 5. This one is a little bit like manuscript except from you literally memorized it word for word you.

                            13. Two students were taking organic chemistry at the university. Having done well in their work and labs, they were both going into the final exam with solid A's. So far so good. Trouble was, they were so confident that they decided to party the night before the big test. It was a great night; one thing led to another, and they ended up sleeping late the following morning. 
They missed the exam! Disasterville! Being inventive souls, though, they went to see the professor to explain that they had been visiting a sick-out-of-town friend the night before. On the way home, they had a flat tire. With no spare tire and no car jack, they were stranded. They could only manage to hitch a lift back to town midmorning, which is why they missed the test. They were really sorry to have missed the exam, they said (they were so looking forward to it!) but wondered whether they might be able to take it that afternoon. 
The professor thought about it for a moment and decided that this would be permissible since they hadn't had time to discuss the exam with any of the students who had already taken it. After a short break for lunch, the two students were ready for the test. The professor placed them in separate rooms, handed each of them an exam booklet, and told to begin. Page one, question one.
