                                            Apply your KnowledgeNow, let’s check what you have learned.Explain the following statements and give your own example.1. Mathematical processes can lead to a kind of model of a thing, from which insights can be gained about the thing itself. Any mathematical relationships arrived at by manipulating abstract statements may or may not convey something truthful about the thing being modelled. (For example, if 2 cups of water are added to 3 cups of water and the abstract mathematical operation 2+3 = 5 is used to calculate the total, the correct answer is 5 cups of water. However, if 2 cups of sugar are added to 3 cups of hot tea and the same operation is used, 5 is an incorrect answer.)2. Sometimes common sense is enough to enable one to decide whether the results of the mathematics are appropriate. (For example, to estimate the height 20 years from now of a girl who is 5' 5" tall and growing at the rate of an inch per year, common sense suggests rejecting the simple "rate times time" answer of 7' 1" as highly unlikely.)3. Often a single round of mathematical reasoning does not produce satisfactory conclusions, and changes are tried in how the representation is made or in the operations themselves. (For example, jumps are commonly made back and forth between steps, and there are no rules that determine how to proceed. The process typically proceeds in fits and starts, with many wrong turns and dead ends. This process continues until the results are good enough.​</a>

                        <p>There are many different ways to approach the question of the morality of human actions. In general, though, there are three main things that are typically considered when determining the morality of an action: the intention behind the action, the consequences of the action, and the context in which the action takes place.</p><p></p><p>The intention behind the action is an important factor in determining its morality. The idea here is that the motivation behind an action can play a big role in whether it is considered right or wrong. For example, if a person steals something with the intention of helping someone in need, their action might be considered more moral than if they stole the same thing with the intention of keeping it for themselves.</p><p></p><p>The consequences of the action are also an important factor in determining its morality. The idea here is that the overall impact of an action on others and on the world can play a big role in whether it is considered right or wrong. For example, if a person chooses to lie in order to avoid hurting someone's feelings, their action might be considered more moral than if they chose to tell the truth and ended up causing a lot of pain and suffering as a result.</p><p></p><p>The context in which the action takes place is also an important factor in determining its morality. The idea here is that the specific circumstances surrounding an action can play a big role in whether it is considered right or wrong. For example, if a person steals food to feed themselves and their family during a time of extreme hunger and poverty, their action might be considered more moral than if they stole the same food just because they wanted it.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.The purpose of a preliminary investigation is only to determine probable cause. As stressed in Hashmin vs. Boncan, 71 Phil. 216, January 31, 1931 ". . . the investigating judge or prosecuting officer acts upon probable cause and reasonable belief, not upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The occasion is not for the full and exhaustive display of the parties' evidence; it is for the presentation of such evidence only as may engender well-grounded belief that an offense has been committed and that the accused is probably guilty thereof. When all this is fulfilled, the accused will not be permitted to cast about for fancied reasons to delay the proceeding; the time to task for more is at the trial.</p><p></p><p>xxx xxx xxx</p><p></p><p>2. Both under the 1935 and 1973 Constitutions, the settled rulings of our jurisprudence, which rulings the drafters of the 1987 Constitution were certainly cognizant of and took into consideration, is that the judge, in the determination of the existence of probable cause for the issuance of the warrant of arrest, may rely upon the certification of the fiscal that he has conducted a preliminary investigation and that a probable cause exists. (See Hashmin vs. Boncan, supra; and Placer vs. Villanueva, 126 SCRA 463, citing U.S. vs. Ocampo, 18 Phil. 1 and Amarga vs. Abbas, 98 Phil. 739).</p><p></p><p>3. The insertion of the word "personally" for the judge's determination of the existence of probable cause in the 1987 Constitution serves to underscore the exclusive and personal responsibility of the issuing judge to satisfy himself of the existence of a probable cause. He is prescribed from delegating this task of investigation to any other person. He must do it personally.</p><p></p><p>4. In satisfying himself of the existence of a probable cause for the issuance of a warrant of arrest, the judge, following the established doctrine and procedure, may either:</p><p></p><p>(a) Rely upon the fiscal's certification of the existence of probable cause whether or not the case is cognizable only by the Regional Trial Court and on the basis thereof, issue a warrant of arrest; or</p><p></p><p>(b) If on the face of the information he finds no probable cause, he may disregard the fiscal's certification and require the submission of the supporting affidavits of witnesses to aid him in arriving at a conclusion as to the existence of a probable cause.</p><p></p><p>5. The Supreme Court admonition should be heeded that while the Constitutions does confer upon the judge the power to conduct preliminary examination preparatory to issuing a warrant of arrest, sound policy reasons should curb the propensity to make use of such competence, since judges of the CFI and CCC (now RTC) "should not encumber themselves with the preliminary examination and investigation of criminal complaints" but should "concentrate on hearing and deciding criminal cases filed before their courts." (Collector of Customs vs. Villaluz and five other cases jointly decided, 71 SCRA 356 [1976]).</p><br />

                            22. Apply your KnowledgeNow, let’s check what you have learned.Explain the following statements and give your own example.1. Mathematical processes can lead to a kind of model of a thing, from which insights can be gained about the thing itself. Any mathematical relationships arrived at by manipulating abstract statements may or may not convey something truthful about the thing being modelled. (For example, if 2 cups of water are added to 3 cups of water and the abstract mathematical operation 2+3 = 5 is used to calculate the total, the correct answer is 5 cups of water. However, if 2 cups of sugar are added to 3 cups of hot tea and the same operation is used, 5 is an incorrect answer.)2. Sometimes common sense is enough to enable one to decide whether the results of the mathematics are appropriate. (For example, to estimate the height 20 years from now of a girl who is 5' 5" tall and growing at the rate of an inch per year, common sense suggests rejecting the simple "rate times time" answer of 7' 1" as highly unlikely.)3. Often a single round of mathematical reasoning does not produce satisfactory conclusions, and changes are tried in how the representation is made or in the operations themselves. (For example, jumps are commonly made back and forth between steps, and there are no rules that determine how to proceed. The process typically proceeds in fits and starts, with many wrong turns and dead ends. This process continues until the results are good enough.​</h2><br />
