Listen to important details.Rapid Urbanization"Today, 50 percent of the Asian population lives in cities. Urbanization has critical implications fordevelopment, since cities are the locus of most social change, most of the demand for more transparent andaccountable government, and the bulk of economic output. The burdens on urban governance are immense,overstretched infrastructure and services constrain economic growth, increase communal conflict, andsignificantly reduce the overall quality of life, especially for the poor. On top of these challenges, Asia's bulgingcities are increasingly vulnerable to environmental disasters: 51 of the 100 cities with the greatest exposure tonatural hazards are in Asia.For example, in Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh, the population has nearly doubled in the last decade,and new construction has driven thousands from the city center to peri-urban areas where services are few ornon-existent, and poor waste management threatens the city's health and economic viability. As part of our workon urban governance we brought together local governments and communities in these areas to raiseawareness of issues like waste management, and prepared a memorandum of solutions for waste collectionand disposal for the governor of Phnom Penh from the Municipal Waste Authority. Now we are collaborating withsolid-waste collectors and City Hall to develop a plan to improve and reform city services and put ideas intoaction."Source: "Six Pressing issues in Asia and How We're Adapting Our Approach to Address Them" by DavidAmold.

Listen to important details.Rapid Urbanization"Today, 50 percent of the Asian population lives in cities. Urbanization has critical implications fordevelopment, since cities are the locus of most social change, most of the demand for more transparent andaccountable government, and the bulk of economic output. The burdens on urban governance are immense,overstretched infrastructure and services constrain economic growth, increase communal conflict, andsignificantly reduce the overall quality of life, especially for the poor. On top of these challenges, Asia's bulgingcities are increasingly vulnerable to environmental disasters: 51 of the 100 cities with the greatest exposure tonatural hazards are in Asia.For example, in Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh, the population has nearly doubled in the last decade,and new construction has driven thousands from the city center to peri-urban areas where services are few ornon-existent, and poor waste management threatens the city's health and economic viability. As part of our workon urban governance we brought together local governments and communities in these areas to raiseawareness of issues like waste management, and prepared a memorandum of solutions for waste collectionand disposal for the governor of Phnom Penh from the Municipal Waste Authority. Now we are collaborating withsolid-waste collectors and City Hall to develop a plan to improve and reform city services and put ideas intoaction."Source: "Six Pressing issues in Asia and How We're Adapting Our Approach to Address Them" by DavidAmold.

EVALUATING AND SELECTING A PREFERRED RISK MANAGEMENT OPTION FORMERCURY IN FISHSituationBox 5 outlines the issues relating to heavy metal (such as mercury) contamination of certain species of fish that can cause risk to public health where the affected species are consumed in sufficient quantities. This case study is set in a rural area that has a significant local fishing and fish processing industry, and fish is an important part of the local diet. Banning harvesting and sale of fish, while addressing the public health and safety risk, may not be the optimal solution as it does not take into account factors such as the importance of fish in the diet, the loss of an important source of protein for many, the loss of livelihoods for fishers, and the impact on the fish processing industry.1.DEFINE THE DECISION PROBLEM.2.IDENTIFY AND SELECT RISK MANAGEMENT OPTIONS.3.DEVELOP A RANGE OF DECISION FACTORS AND CRITERIA BY WHICH THEOPTIONS WILL BE ASSESSED.4.GATHER EVIDENCE, EVALUATE AND COMPARE ALTERNATIVES (RISK MANAGEMENT OPTIONS).5.CHOOSE THE BEST OPTION (ALTERNATIVE).​</h2><br />
