Write youranswers on your notebook.1. When we read, we often are asked to answer questions or express our ideasabout the text. In order to let people, know we aren't making stuff up, weshould use Cite Evidence to support our opinions or answers.2. In real life, people who can back up an opinion about a text with Evidenceare taken more seriously than people who can only give a reason of “justbecause."3. If you use direct quotes from a text, you must use quotation marks.4. When we examine an author's message, often called the central idea,and most accurately called the “AUTHOR'S CLAIM”, it is important not toexamine the way an author supports his ideas.5. In citing evidence, we look for different types of evidence, such as FACTS,STATISTICS, EXAMPLES, EXPERT TESTIMONY, andREASONING.LOGICAL6. Using evidence means that we need to explain how the author supportshis claim by presenting a particular fact or example.7. In citing evidence, paraphrase is one of the forms. A paraphrase meansthat you have translated the author's words your own.8. Citing textual evidence makes your argument less powerful.9. The evidence you pick shows that you understand what you are actuallyreading10. Textual evidence goes beyond just your opinions, thoughts, feelings.​</a>

                        <p>Answer:</p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p>Arthur Schopenhauer, a 19th century German philosopher, interprets life as amounting to suffering in his work "The World as Will and Representation." He argues that the fundamental aspect of existence is not the rational, conscious self, but rather the underlying will to live, which he refers to as the "will to exist." This will is the source of all suffering, as it drives individuals to constantly seek pleasure and avoid pain, leading to a never-ending cycle of desire and disappointment.</p><p></p><p>Schopenhauer believes that the will to exist makes life more insufferable by constantly creating new desires and needs that can never truly be satisfied, resulting in a state of constant dissatisfaction. He states, "Desire is never satisfied by the satisfaction of a desire; indeed, the satisfaction of one desire is but the beginning of another" (Klemke and Cahn, 2017, p.88). He also believes that suffering outweighs pleasure in life because suffering is more intense and longer-lasting than pleasure.</p><p></p><p>Schopenhauer rejects God as a source of meaning in life because he argues that the concept of God only serves to perpetuate the cycle of suffering caused by the will to exist. He states, "If God were to grant us all our desires and needs, we would only desire for more and greater things" (Klemke and Cahn, 2017, p.89). He also argues that love is not capable of providing meaning because it is ultimately driven by the will to exist and therefore leads to suffering.</p><p></p><p>Despite his assertion that life is meaningless, Schopenhauer does not advocate for suicide as an appropriate choice. Instead, he advises individuals to detach themselves from their desires and needs in order to find peace and contentment. He suggests that individuals should focus on cultivating a sense of detachment and detachment from the will to exist, which he believes can lead to a state of contentment and tranquility.</p><p></p><p>However, one could argue that Schopenhauer's views are overly pessimistic and fail to take into account the positive aspects of life such as love, joy, and compassion. Additionally, his emphasis on detachment and denial of desires can be seen as a rejection of human nature and a failure to fully engage with the world.</p><p></p><p>Personally, while I acknowledge the validity of Schopenhauer's argument that suffering is an inherent part of the human experience, I believe that it is important to also recognize and appreciate the positive aspects of life. Therefore, I do not fully agree with his views.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, Schopenhauer's interpretation of life as amounting to suffering is rooted in his belief that the fundamental aspect of existence is the will to live, which drives individuals to constantly seek pleasure and avoid pain, leading to a never-ending cycle of desire and disappointment. He rejects God and love as sources of meaning in life and instead advises individuals to detach themselves from their desires and needs in order to find peace and contentment. However, his views have been criticized for being overly pessimistic and for rejecting human nature.</p><br />

Write TRUE if the statement is true about citing evidenceand write FALSF if it is not correct.1 When we read, we often are asked to answer questions or express our ideas about the text.

In real lite, people who can back up an opinion about a text with Evidence are taken more seriously thanpeople who can only give a reason of just because."3. li you use direct quotes from a text, you must use quotation marks.4. When we examine an author's message, often called the central idea, and most accurately called the"AUTHOR'S CLAIM", it is important not to examine the way an author supports his ideas5. In citing evidence, we look for different types of evidence, such as FACTS, STATISTICS, EXAMPLES,EXPERT TESTIMONY, and LOGICAL REASONING.6. Using evidence means that we need to explain how the author supports his clam by presenting aparticular fact or example7. In citing evidence, paraphrase is one of the forms. A paraphrase means that you have translated theauthor's words your own.8 Citing textual evidence makes your argument less powerful9. The evidence you pick shows that you understand what you are actually reading10. Textual evidence goes beyond just your opinions, thoughts, and feelings.​</h2><br />

In order to let people, know we aren't making stuff up, weshould use Cite Evidence to support our opinions or answers.2. In real life, people who can back up an opinion about a text with Evidenceare taken more seriously than people who can only give a reason of “justbecause."3. If you use direct quotes from a text, you must use quotation marks.4. When we examine an author's message, often called the central idea,and most accurately called the “AUTHOR'S CLAIM”, it is important not toexamine the way an author supports his ideas.5. In citing evidence, we look for different types of evidence, such as FACTS,STATISTICS, EXAMPLES, EXPERT TESTIMONY, andREASONING.LOGICAL6. Using evidence means that we need to explain how the author supportshis claim by presenting a particular fact or example.7. In citing evidence, paraphrase is one of the forms. A paraphrase meansthat you have translated the author's words your own.8. Citing textual evidence makes your argument less powerful.9. The evidence you pick shows that you understand what you are actuallyreading10. Textual evidence goes beyond just your opinions, thoughts, feelings.​</h2><br />

</p><p>Explain the two forms of plagiarism and how to avoid them
</p><p>Explain the importance of academic integrity and the potential consequences of not abiding by this
</p><p>  </p><p>
</p><p>In this chapter you are going to learn more about compiling references and citations. You will also learn strategies for handling some of the more challenging aspects of writing a research paper, such as integrating material from your sources, citing information correctly, and avoiding any misuse of your sources. The first section of this chapter will introduce you to broad concepts associated with adding support to your ideas and providing documentation—citations and references—when you use sources in your papers.
</p><p>
</p><p>Using Primary and Secondary Research
</p><p>
</p><p>As you write your draft, be mindful of how you are using primary and secondary source material to support your points. Recall that primary sources present firsthand information. Secondary sources are one step removed from primary sources. They present a writer’s analysis or interpretation of primary source materials. How you balance primary and secondary source material in your paper will depend on the topic and assignment.
</p><p>
</p><p>Using Primary Sources Effectively
</p><p>
</p><p>Some types of research papers must use primary sources extensively to achieve their purpose. Any paper that analyzes a primary text or presents the writer’s own experimental research falls in this category. Here are a few examples:
</p><p>
</p><p>A paper for a literature course analyzing several poems by Emily Dickinson
</p><p>
</p><p>A paper for a political science course comparing televised speeches delivered by two candidates for prime minister
</p><p>
</p><p>A paper for a communications course discussing gender bias in television commercials
</p><p>
</p><p>A paper for a business administration course that discusses the results of a survey the writer conducted with local businesses to gather information about their work from home and flextime policies
</p><p>
</p><p>A paper for an elementary education course that discusses the results of an experiment the writer conducted to compare the effectiveness of two different methods of mathematics instruction
</p><p>
</p><p>For these types of papers, primary research is the main focus. If you are writing about a work (including non-print works, such as a movie or a painting), it is crucial to gather information and ideas from the original work, rather than rely solely on others’ interpretations. And, of course, if you take the time to design and conduct your own field research, such as a survey, a series of interviews, or an experiment, you will want to discuss it in detail. For example, the interviews may provide interesting responses that you want to share with your reader.
</p><p>
</p><p>Using Secondary Sources Effectively
</p><p>
</p><p>For some assignments, it makes sense to rely more on secondary sources than primary sources. If you are not analyzing a text or conducting your own field research, you will need to use secondary sources extensively.
</p><p>
</p><p>As much as possible, use secondary sources that are closely linked to primary research, such as a journal article presenting the results of the authors’ scientific study or a book that cites interviews and case studies. These sources are more reliable and add more value to your paper than sources that are further removed from primary research. For instance, a popular magazine article on junk food addiction might be several steps removed from the original scientific study on which it is loosely based. As a result, the article may distort, sensationalize, or misinterpret the scientists’ findings.
</p><p>
</p><p>Even if your paper is largely based on primary sources, you may use secondary sources to develop your ideas. For instance, an analysis of Alfred Hitchcock’s films would focus on the films themselves as a primary source, but might also cite commentary from critics. A paper that presents an original experiment would include some discussion of similar prior research in the field.
</p><p>
</p><p>Jorge, who is preparing his essay on low-carbohydrate diets, knew he did not have the time, resources, or experience needed to conduct original experimental research for his paper. Because he was relying on secondary sources to support his ideas, he made a point of citing sources that were not far removed from primary research.
