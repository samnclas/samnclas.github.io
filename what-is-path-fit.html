                                            Read and pick one of the two excerpts below that sound more convincing to you.  A. “I will bring you life, joy, peace and happiness. I am everywhere and in everything. You can worship me however you wish and I will accept you and help you see how powerful you are. I have created you and put my goodness and power in you. I don’t have rules for you to follow but I want you to reach your full potential by finding and enjoying the life that resides within you. I will lead you and help you enjoy life without restricting you. I only want to help you find the path of life that best fits you so we can become one in the way that fits you best.” -Vishnu(Hinduism) B. “I know life is difficult and I am here to help free you from the pain and difficulties of this life. I don’t have a specific path for you to follow. You can live how you want. If you want to escape the pain and suffering of this world then I will help you disconnect from the things of this world so you can be free from pain and suffering.” – Siddhartha Gautama (Buddhism) Guide Questions: 1. Why have you selected that excerpt? 2. What does your chosen excerpt entail? 3. State one limitation (hindrance/challenge) that you are experiencing now as a SHS student and how can you overcome it as you achieve your own transcendence (best of yourself) by using your chosen excerpt.</a>

You can worship me however you wish and I will accept you and help you see how powerful you are. I have created you and put my goodness and power in you. I don’t have rules for you to follow but I want you to reach your full potential by finding and enjoying the life that resides within you. I will lead you and help you enjoy life without restricting you. I only want to help you find the path of life that best fits you so we can become one in the way that fits you best.” -Vishnu(Hinduism) B. “I know life is difficult and I am here to help free you from the pain and difficulties of this life. I don’t have a specific path for you to follow. You can live how you want. If you want to escape the pain and suffering of this world then I will help you disconnect from the things of this world so you can be free from pain and suffering.” – Siddhartha Gautama (Buddhism) Guide Questions: 1. Why have you selected that excerpt? 2. What does your chosen excerpt entail? 3.
