Sieving is used in our homes to separate liquid ingredients from other impurities such as stones, stalks, and husks 6 Fishermen commonly use sieve in separating their catch from the water in any bodies of water. 7. In sieving or sifting, the size of the particles that will be separated from the mixture always depends on the size of the holes of the sieve to be used 8 A sieve or sifter is a device for separating wanted elements from unwanted material or for characterizing the particle size 9. The sand can pass through the openings of the sieve because to its fine particles. 10 Handpicking is faster than sieving or sifting in separating solid mixtures according to their sizes.​</a>

Do this in your Science notebook. :( 1. Force is use in our everyday life. 2. Force can make a body, which is inactive to move. 3. We can walk easily without force.. 4. If similar force is applied to two objects, the heavier object will move slower. 5. We could live without force. 6. Force can also make objects stay where they are. 7. We don't need force when we want to change the motion of our body. 8. We use force in squeezing wet clothes to remove the water from the clothes 9. When a force of some amount is applied to a body, it begins to move. 10. Force has no varied effects and applications in everyday life.​</a>

1.Technology is the application of science.
2.Scientific theories are much less valid than scientific laws.
3.Science and technology has potentially negative societal impacts. 
4.STS is a multidisciplinary study and draws heavily on the social sciences.
5.Science mainly concerns on the acquisition and production of knowledge from the natural world.
6.Though the knowledge generated by STS is important, it has little bearing on government policy-making.
7.The study of STS is important for both the natural science community and the social science community.
8.The domain of science requires skills such as critical thinking and problem-solving but less on creativity and imagination.
9.When we try to look into how various social factors affect the development of science and how developments in science affect human society, we are delving into the STS territory.
10.STS deals mostly with historical developments of science and technology and its impact to society and less with the philosophical implications of these developments.</a>

Sieving is used in our homes to separate liquid ingredients from other impurities such as stones, stalks, and husks 6 Fishermen commonly use sieve in separating their catch from the water in any bodies of water. 7. In sieving or sifting, the size of the particles that will be separated from the mixture always depends on the size of the holes of the sieve to be used 8 A sieve or sifter is a device for separating wanted elements from unwanted material or for characterizing the particle size 9. The sand can pass through the openings of the sieve because to its fine particles. 10 Handpicking is faster than sieving or sifting in separating solid mixtures according to their sizes.​</h2><br />

2.Scientific theories are much less valid than scientific laws.
3.Science and technology has potentially negative societal impacts. 
4.STS is a multidisciplinary study and draws heavily on the social sciences.
5.Science mainly concerns on the acquisition and production of knowledge from the natural world.
6.Though the knowledge generated by STS is important, it has little bearing on government policy-making.
7.The study of STS is important for both the natural science community and the social science community.
8.The domain of science requires skills such as critical thinking and problem-solving but less on creativity and imagination.
9.When we try to look into how various social factors affect the development of science and how developments in science affect human society, we are delving into the STS territory.
