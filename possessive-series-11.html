They are sci- entific examinations of a particular social phenomenon.</p><p>2.Lombroso's (1876) theory of criminology suggests that criminality is inherited and that someone "born criminal" could be identified by the way they look.</p><p>3.A man is rational in his actions if they are performed in accordance with some sensible reasons which make the aim he pursues possible of attainment.</p><p>4.Rehabilitation has different programs such as drug addict rehab program, violent behavior rehab program and so on. ... This brings us to the point that rehabilitation is a much better option than punishment because it would help an offender become a peaceful citizen and live a normal life.</p><p>5.Crime is normal because a society without crime would be impossible. Behaviors considered unacceptable have increased, as society progresses not decreases. If a society is operating as its normal healthy self the rate of deviance should change very little. ...
