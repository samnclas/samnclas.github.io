                                            Name of Teacher: EVALUATION DIRECTIONS: Read and understand the biography of Jose Rizal. Answer the questions JOSE RIZAL Jose Rizal was born on June 19, 1861 in Calamba, Laguna, Philippines as Jose Protacio Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda. He was a writer, known for El Filibusterismo (1962), Sisa (1951) and Noli Me Tangere (1930). He died on December 30, 1896 in Bagumbayan (now Luneta), Manila, Philippines. He was a skilled linguist; in his many travels in Europe and Asia, he was able to pick up the language of whatever country he visited and stayed for a protracted amount of time. He was also a talented artist, and there are sketches of his work which are still intact today. He was married to an Irish woman, Josephine Bracken, toward the end of his life. They had a son, but he died shortly after birth. Before he was executed on 30 December 1894, he requested to be shot facing the firing squad, and this had denied him, so they shot him in the back. Despite this, after the squad opened fire, Rizal summoned his strength and turned to face the soldiers, and then fell flat on his back with his eyes looking in the sky. 1. When was Jose Rizal executed? 2. How did he learn the different languages? 3. What point of view did the writer use in this selection? 4. What is the purpose of the author in writing the story? 5. If you were Jose Rizal, would you do the same as he did for the country?​</a>
