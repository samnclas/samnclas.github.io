                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Answer:</p><p></p><p>What means ur mom?</p><p></p><p>What does your mom mean? Your mom is a phrase that's typically followed by a statement poking fun at someone's mom. This always involves hyperbolic statements revolving around a personal trait that she may or may not possess,Is it Your mom or Your mom?</p><p></p><p>If an article or pronoun is there, don't capitalize (e.g., your mother is pretty). If there is no article or pronoun, then the word is being used as a proper noun and is capitalized (e.g., that dress looks good on Mom)</p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p></p><p>What is your mother name or mother's name?</p><p></p><p>What is your mother's name? is correct. There are two reasons for this. First, mother has to be in possessive case as her name belongs to her. Second, the part of speech of mother is noun and hence its possessive case is formed by adding 's to the word mother,What is the name of the mother?</p><p></p><p>The Mother (How I Met Your Mother)</p><p></p><p>Tracy McConnell</p><p></p><p>Alias The Mother, T.M</p><p></p><p>Gender Female</p><p></p><p>Spouse Ted Mosby ​ ( m. 2020)​</p><p></p><p>Children Penny Mosby (daughter) Luke Mosby (son)</p><p></p><p>How do I ask my mother name?</p><p></p><p>"What's your mother's name?"

                        <strong>Answer:</strong><strong></strong><strong>What means ur mom?</strong><strong></strong><strong>What does your mom mean? Your mom is a phrase that's typically followed by a statement poking fun at someone's mom. This always involves hyperbolic statements revolving around a personal trait that she may or may not possess,Is it Your mom or Your mom?</strong><strong></strong><strong>If an article or pronoun is there, don't capitalize (e.g., your mother is pretty). If there is no article or pronoun, then the word is being used as a proper noun and is capitalized (e.g., that dress looks good on Mom)</strong><strong></strong><strong>Explanation:</strong><strong></strong><strong>What is your mother name or mother's name?</strong><strong></strong><strong>What is your mother's name? is correct. There are two reasons for this. First, mother has to be in possessive case as her name belongs to her. Second, the part of speech of mother is noun and hence its possessive case is formed by adding 's to the word mother,What is the name of the mother?</strong><strong></strong><strong>The Mother (How I Met Your Mother)</strong><strong></strong><strong>Tracy McConnell</strong><strong></strong><strong>Alias The Mother, T.M</strong><strong></strong><strong>Gender Female</strong><strong></strong><strong>Spouse Ted Mosby ​ ( m. 2020)​</strong><strong></strong><strong>Children Penny Mosby (daughter) Luke Mosby (son)</strong><strong></strong><strong>How do I ask my mother name?</strong><strong></strong><strong>"What's your mother's name?"
