</p>
In the story of <strong>Sang Kancil</strong>,  I 'd say he was really <strong>clever</strong>.  Actually, it's a very <strong>wise</strong>  thing to do to survive.  This may be a folk tale, but it  could happen to real people in real life.  We tend to depend on someone  who can survive or live the day.  
People experience more complicated situations than Sang Kancil, but  what are we going to do to overcome them?  Are we as clever  as Sang Kancil is?  But do we have to <strong>trick</strong>  someone just to get what we want?  We are human  beings, as I said.  We have the capacity to  think and understand every situation.  We know what's  right and wrong.  Be smart  and be wise.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Sang Kancil doesn't have any bridge to cross the riverside that's why he outwitted Sang Buaya, a big, bad crocodile, who wanted to eat him. There were many trees where Sang Kancil's lived along the river, so he never had trouble finding food. There were always lots of leaves. He spent his time running and jumping and looking into the river.
</p><p>Sang Buaya, the big bad crocodile, lived in the river with other crocodiles. They were always waiting to catch Sang Kancil for dinner. One day when Sang Buaya was walking along the river, he saw some delicious fruit on the trees on the other side the river.
</p><p>Sang Kancil wanted to taste the tasty-looking fruit because he was a little tired of eating leaves. He tried to think of a way to cross the river, but he had to be careful. He didn't want to be caught and eaten by Sang Buaya. He needed to trick Sang Buaya.
</p><p>He asked Sang Kancil, "Aren't you afraid I will eat you?" Then he opened his big mouth very wide to scare Sang Kancil.
</p><p> Sang Kancil said, "Of course, I am afraid of you, but the king wants me to do something. He is having a big feast with lots of food, and he is inviting everyone, including you and all the other crocodiles. But first, I have to count all of you. He needs to know how many of you will come. Please line up across the river, so I can walk across your heads and count all of you."
</p><p>Sang Buaya was excited and left to tell the other crocodiles about the feast with all the good food. Sang Kancil said, "Promise not to eat me because or I can't report to the king how many of you are coming. They promised not to eat him.   Sang Kancil stepped on Sang Buaya's head and counted one. Then he stepped on the next one and said, "Two." He stepped on each crocodile, counting each one, and finally reached the other side of the river. Then he said to Sang Buaya,"Thank you for helping me to cross the river to my new home."   Sang Buaya was shocked and angry. He shouted at Sang Kancil, "You tricked us! There is no feast, is there?" All of the crocodiles looked at Sang Buaya angrily. They were angry because he let Sang Kancil trick all of them.  Sang Kancil loved his new home on the other side of the river because he had a lot of tasty food to eat. Poor Sang Buaya was not so lucky. After that, none of the other crocodiles ever talked to him again.
</p><p> Pilandok was asked by his mother one morning, to pick mangoes in the village of Mabunga, Pilandok had to cross a river.  But the bridge had collapse and the river was home to large crocodiles.
</p><p>Pilandok asked the leader of the crocodiles permission to cross the river but the leader told him that they eat whoever crosses the river.  Pilandok thought of a plan to cross the river safely.  He asked the leader how many crocodiles are there, and the leader answer twenty.  Pilandok pretended to count and say that they are only ten crocodiles. The leader shouted “that’s impossible, we’re twenty all in all.”  Pilandok calmly said to the crocodile to line up so that he could count them all to be sure that no one is missing.  The crocodiles followed Pilandok’s suggestion and line up side by side.  Pilandok step on each crocodile’s backs as he counts.  Pilandok hopped onto the other side of the river before finally shouting “Twenty!”  Pilandok hurriedly picked the mangoes and filled his bag with ripe, big, and sweet mangoes.  He even ate some and fell asleep after eating.  It was afternoon when he woke up and was delighted when he saw the river quiet and without any crocodiles.   When he reached the middle of the river, the crocodiles suddenly appeared.  “We will eat you, we want your liver,” growled the leader of the crocodiles.  “Wait,” said Pilandok “I left my liver at home because it is bad for my liver to get wet.” Pilandok jumped onto the back of the crocodile and said, “Take me to the other side and I will get my liver from our house.”  When they reached the shore, Pilandok quickly hopped off the back of the crocodile and ran home.  Twice, Pilandok succeeded in tricking the hungry crocodiles in the river.  The crocodiles were foolish enough to believe that a person could leave behind his own liver.  Pilandok returned with a piece of wood and asked the crocodiles who has the largest mouth so that he could give his liver for it grew big when he left it at home.  The leader of the crocodiles opened his mouth to the fullest and Pilandok put the piece of wood inside his wide-opened mouth.  It was too late for the crocodile to realize that he had again been deceived by the clever Pilandok, who could not close his big mouth because of the piece of wood.
