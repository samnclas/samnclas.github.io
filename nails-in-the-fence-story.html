                                            THE NAIL ON THE FENCE There once was a little boy who had a bad temper. His father gave him a bag of nails and told him that every time he lost his temper, he must hammer a nail into the fence. The first day the boy had driven 37 nails into the fence. Over the next few weeks as he learned to control his anger, the number of nails hammered daily, gradually dwindled down. He discovered it was easier to hold his temper than to hammer those nails into the fence. Finally, the day came when the boy didn't lose his temper at all. He told his father about it and the father suggested that the boy now pull out one nail for each day that he was able to hold his temper. The days passed and the young boy was finally able to tell his father that all the nails were gone. The father took his son by the hand and led him to the fence. He said "You have done well, my son, but look at the holes in the fence. The fence will never be the some. When you say things in anger, they leave a scar just like this one You can put a knife in a man and draw it out. It won't matter how many times you say I'm sorry, the wound is still there. 1. Do you like the consequence here for the boy losing his temper? Is fair? 2. What about the temper or anger being compared to the scars on the fence from all the nail holes? Is that really going too far, or is it the perfect consequence? 3. The last statement "You can put a knife in a man and draw it out. but the wound is still there, no matter how many times you say I'm sorry". Comment on the value of this story.

                                            There once was a little boy who had a very bad temper. His father decided to hand him a bag of nails and said that every time the by lost his temper, he had to hammer a nail into the fence.
On the first day, the boy hammered 37 nails into that fence. The boy gradually began to control his temper over the next few weeks, and number of nails he was hammering into the fence slowly decreased. He discovered it was easier to control his temper than to hammer those nails into the fence.
Finally, the day came when the boy didn’t lose his temper at all. He told his father the news and the father suggested that the boy should now pull out a nail every day he kept his temper under control.
The days passed and the young boy was finally able to tell his father that all the nails were gone. The father took his son by the hand and led him to the fence.

                            6. THE NAIL ON THE FENCE There once was a little boy who had a bad temper. His father gave him a bag of nails and told him that every time he lost his temper, he must hammer a nail into the fence. The first day the boy had driven 37 nails into the fence. Over the next few weeks as he learned to control his anger, the number of nails hammered daily, gradually dwindled down. He discovered it was easier to hold his temper than to hammer those nails into the fence. Finally, the day came when the boy didn't lose his temper at all. He told his father about it and the father suggested that the boy now pull out one nail for each day that he was able to hold his temper. The days passed and the young boy was finally able to tell his father that all the nails were gone. The father took his son by the hand and led him to the fence. He said "You have done well, my son, but look at the holes in the fence. The fence will never be the some. When you say things in anger, they leave a scar just like this one You can put a knife in a man and draw it out. It won't matter how many times you say I'm sorry, the wound is still there. 1. Do you like the consequence here for the boy losing his temper? Is fair? 2. What about the temper or anger being compared to the scars on the fence from all the nail holes? Is that really going too far, or is it the perfect consequence? 3. The last statement "You can put a knife in a man and draw it out. but the wound is still there, no matter how many times you say I'm sorry". Comment on the value of this story.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Yes, because it's not just a consequence to help him to control his temper.

But on the other hand, it is really going too far because it's also teach us to be careful in the decisions that we are made because it can hurt feelings that will leave a mark on the heart and cannot be remove or fade away.</p><p>3.

Forgiveness is a way to the reconciliation of differences.

Forgive others while you still have a chance of reconciliation. Never hold grudges because there are consequences of every act that we do.

If only she was able to forgive, her son would have not died.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            25. how are iking and the young girl affected by the fences build by the mother in the story the fence by jose garcia villa</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Hate
</p><p>Their rancour and hatred stem from their history and what happened that one night. Aling Biang caught her husband with their neighbour, Aling Sebia. Aling Sebia was a childless widow who showed a lack of guilt and remorse at her actions.
</p><p>
</p><p>The husband of Aling Biang left after his misdemeanour was caught and his wife did not bother to pursue after him. The betrayal, the hurt, and the memory had hardened her heart.
</p><p>
</p><p>Both the women were left with a festering dislike for each other, so much so that they refused to even water the vegetable rows between the two houses, lest the water replenished their neighbour’s plants.
</p><p>
</p><p>Children
</p><p>As the story unfolds, we read about Aling Sebia’s pregnancy and the only person who could help her was Aling Biang. And she did but even that did not end the bitterness which goes on unabated. The children of the two women,
</p><p>
</p><p>Ad
</p><p>
</p><p>Sebia’s daughter and Biang’s son Iking grow up oblivious to each other’s existence. They are innocent victims of their family feud. They, too, are sentenced to desolation on either side of the merciless bamboo fence. They both are not gifted physically but in their loneliness, long for company and even friendship.
</p><p>
</p><p>One day Iking sneaks a peek at the girl through the withering fence and his heart is captivated by her. Even though she seems uglier than him, the need for companionship makes him fall for the only girl he has ever seen.
</p><p>
</p><p>Then he hears her play the guitar. She does not complete her notes and Iking is desperate to hear her complete. Aling Biang tries to instil hatred in Iking’s in Iking’s heart but he shows signs of quiet resistance.
</p><p>
</p><p>Gradually but surely he gets drawn to the music coming from the house next to his. He even starts sleeping by the door where he is able to hear the guitar being played by the girl. He feels the urge to destroy the fence but his mother bolsters the decaying fence and eventually even the guitar stops playing.
</p><p>
</p><p>Ad
</p><p>
</p><p>  </p><p>
</p><p>Tragic End
</p><p>Then the story moves for three years and we arrive on Christmas day. Iking is emaciated and weak having being deprived of the girl’s sight and music. His mother Aling Biang asks him to rest while she prays to God.
</p><p>
</p><p>But Iking only yearns to hear the guitar and goes to the fence. Through the slits in the fence, he whispers to the girl. He wants her to play the guitar and she looks at him, seemingly in agreement.
</p><p>
</p><p>He waits for the girl to honour his muted request. But there is no music. He is afraid that the girl might have a fence in her against him even though he does not. Unfortunately, at 2 in the morning, the boy dies before the girl could answer his wishes.
</p><p>
</p><p>At 2:03 am, guitar music comes. But it is too late and Iking’s last wish goes unanswered. Even though the musical notes are now complete, they have lost their patron. Aling Biang scoffs at the guitar music as she considers it disrespectful to his son’s death.
</p><p>
</p><p>Ad
</p><p>
</p><p>  </p><p>In the end, even his death fails to soften her heart and bring the modicum of sensitivity and forgiveness. The fence remains as formidable as before. The story leaves the reader with many questions.
</p><p>
</p><p>Where is the man who was as guilty as Aling Sebia? Why can not the two victims, the two neighbours, show compassion to each other? Why does the flame of hate be more powerful than the winds of empathy and forgiveness?
</p><p>
</p><p>Key Thoughts
</p><p>The prime teaching of the story is the importance of forgiveness. Forgiveness offers a chance to reconcile our differences. The lesson highlighted is that our actions have consequences and it is unhealthy to carry grudges when those consequences are adverse.
</p><p>
</p><p>Human beings are liable to make mistakes and errors but it is higher human quality to forgive mistakes and make room for repentance. If we learn to forgive each other then we can help foster mutual trust and confidence.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

If we learn to forgive one another it will make our relations strong and also build trust.</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The story "The Fence" by Jose Garcia Villa does not have a clear conclusion, as it is an open-ended piece of literature that leaves the interpretation of the events up to the reader. However, the story revolves around a man who builds a fence around his property and becomes increasingly isolated from the outside world. Throughout the story, the man struggles with his desire for privacy and his need for human connection. The story ends with the man continuing to live alone behind his fence, with the implication that he is still struggling to find a balance between his need for privacy and his need for social interaction.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                            27. Moral lesson of story THE FENCE by Jose Garcia Villa</h2><br />
                        <p>The moral lesson of the story The Fence is to be forgiving.
Forgive others while you still have a chance of reconciliation. Never hold
grudges because there are consequences of every act that we do. The Fence is
all about the mother who could not forgive her neighbour for having an affair
with her husband. She then built a fence and they did not talk again. If only
she was able to forgive, her son would have not died. </p>
