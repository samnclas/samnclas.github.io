Sleep Experts say that people (adults) need at least 6 hours of sleep every night. If they do not get enough sleep they will feel sleepy the whole day. Younger kids need at least 9 hours of sleep every night. After school -activities can take away from sleep time for kids. Also parents with busy lifestyles stay up late and their kids do the same. Kids with little sleep have a hard time sleeping at night and this will affect their daily routine and make them less active and productive throughout the day in school. Most parents are not aware of what goes on when their kids go to sleep and how the brain works when we are asleep. May people think that the brain shuts down when we go to sleep but it is the opposite. Experts say that the brain is very active when we are asleep and could be even more active than when we are awake. Experts recommend at least 6 hours of sleep for adults and 9 hours of sleep for young children. They say that sleep is an essential not a comfort and it can increase your life expectancy.

                                            kay, smartypants, you might think you know the answers to most questions, but have you ever been asked a trick question? Unlike trivia questions, these don’t require a whole lot of knowledge or experience. Trick questions are, well, tricky. The whole purpose is to try to deceive you into offering up an answer that isn’t correct. And truth be told, we could all use an exercise in futility every now and then. If you do happen to knock these out of the park, though, you get to feel like the most clever person around.
It’s also a great exercise for your brain. So, if you want to give your mind a workout, you’ve come to the right place. Trick questions are not only fun, but they make you think. And it’s fun for the whole family! Your kids will shriek with laughter at these silly brain stumpers, especially once they hear the answers. The best part about these trick questions is that just when you think you have the right answer, it turns out to be even simpler than you thought. These queries are the titans of deception and so much fun.</a>

Sleep Experts say that people (adults) need at least 6 hours of sleep every night. If they do not get enough sleep they will feel sleepy the whole day. Younger kids need at least 9 hours of sleep every night. After school -activities can take away from sleep time for kids. Also parents with busy lifestyles stay up late and their kids do the same. Kids with little sleep have a hard time sleeping at night and this will affect their daily routine and make them less active and productive throughout the day in school. Most parents are not aware of what goes on when their kids go to sleep and how the brain works when we are asleep. May people think that the brain shuts down when we go to sleep but it is the opposite. Experts say that the brain is very active when we are asleep and could be even more active than when we are awake. Experts recommend at least 6 hours of sleep for adults and 9 hours of sleep for young children. They say that sleep is an essential not a comfort and it can increase your life expectancy.

The whole purpose is to try to deceive you into offering up an answer that isn’t correct. And truth be told, we could all use an exercise in futility every now and then. If you do happen to knock these out of the park, though, you get to feel like the most clever person around.
It’s also a great exercise for your brain. So, if you want to give your mind a workout, you’ve come to the right place. Trick questions are not only fun, but they make you think. And it’s fun for the whole family! Your kids will shriek with laughter at these silly brain stumpers, especially once they hear the answers. The best part about these trick questions is that just when you think you have the right answer, it turns out to be even simpler than you thought.
