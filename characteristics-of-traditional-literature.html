During the Pre-Spanish Period, Jose Rizal's works such as Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo were written to awake the mind of the Filipino people. 2.

The most prominent characteristic of Philippine literature during the Spanish era was the use of religion as the content in the works of the early literature, 5. The separate, yet parallel developments of Philippine literature in English and those in Tagalog and other languages of the archipelago during the American period only proved that literature and writing in whatever language and in whatever climate were able to survive mainly through the active imagination of writers. 6. Poetry works during the EDSA I Period were romantic and revolutionary. 7. Doctrina Cristiana and Urbana and Felisa were written to support or contradict the Catholic Church during the Period of Enlightenment. 8. It was during the American Period when Filipinos witnessed newspapers which were once branded crony newspapers become instant opposition papers.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Some defining features of 21st century literature of the Philippines include experimentation with form and language, the exploration of complex and nuanced themes, and a focus on the intersection of multiple identities and experiences.</p><p></p><p>Contemporary Philippine literature often addresses themes of identity, culture, and politics through a lens that is critical, reflective, and engaged with the social and political realities of the country. Writers often grapple with questions of what it means to be Filipino in the 21st century and how that identity is shaped by the country's history, culture, and political landscape.</p><p></p><p>Recent technological, social, and cultural changes have had a significant impact on the themes and forms of Philippine literature in the 21st century. These changes have led to the emergence of new forms of writing and new ways of telling stories, and have also opened up new avenues for writers to reach audiences both within and beyond the Philippines.</p><p></p><p>The Filipino diaspora plays a significant role in 21st century Philippine literature, as writers explore the experiences of Filipinos living abroad and the impact of migration on their sense of identity and belonging. These works often challenge traditional notions of what it means to be Filipino and how that identity is constructed and maintained.</p><p></p><p>21st century Philippine literature often challenges traditional notions of gender, sexuality, and relationships by exploring the complexity and diversity of human experience. Writers often seek to subvert stereotypes and highlight the unique experiences of marginalized groups, including LGBTQ+ communities.</p><p></p><p>Many works of 21st century Philippine literature address issues of social justice, including poverty, inequality, and human rights. These works often serve as a critique of the political and social systems that perpetuate these issues and offer a vision for a more just and equitable society.</p><p></p><p>21st century Philippine literature engages with the country's colonial history and its legacy in the present day by exploring the ways in which colonialism has shaped Philippine culture and identity. These works often seek to reclaim and reinterpret aspects of Philippine history and culture that have been marginalized or erased by colonialism.</p><p></p><p>Some significant literary movements or trends in 21st century Philippine literature include the rise of "new realism," which focuses on the everyday experiences of ordinary Filipinos, and the emergence of "speculative fiction," which combines elements of fantasy and science fiction with Philippine folklore and culture.</p><p></p><p>21st century Philippine literature uses language and form to convey meaning and emotion to readers in a variety of ways, including the use of vernacular language, experimentation with form and structure, and the incorporation of visual elements like graphic novels and comics.</p><p></p><p>Contemporary Philippine writers face a range of challenges, including limited access to publishing opportunities and the need to navigate complex political and social realities. Many writers are responding to these challenges by exploring new forms of storytelling, experimenting with language and form, and engaging with social and political issues in their work.</p><p></p><p></p><br />
