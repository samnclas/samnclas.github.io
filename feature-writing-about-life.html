                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Earth's lithosphere is a cracked planetary shell floating on a dense, liquid mantle. These cracks are that fault lines that we have today and the pieces of the shell are what we call tectonic plates. There are two major factors that results to the movement of the lithosphere: The instability of the mantle as materials of different density are interacting with each other, and the difference in density of the tectonic plates. As the mantle below moves, <strong>plates above are also forced to move along with it, causing earthquakes</strong>.</p><p>The case of differential density between tectonic plates is illustrated by the <strong>formation of the Himalayas mountain range</strong> and why the highest peaks on the planet, including Mt Everest, are located in the area. As the instability of the mantle below drives the denser Indo-Australian plate against the relatively lighter Eurasian plate. This results to the buckling of both plates, with the  Indo-Australian plate going under and pushing the Eurasian plate upwards, resulting growth of Himalayas at more than 1cm per year. This collision not only produce the beautiful Himalayas, but it also responsible for the creation of the Tibetan plateau and consequently  contributed to the desertification of the Taklamakan desert, while the rising moisture from the Indian ocean along the ridge of the Himalayas contributes to the formation of monsoons.</p><p></p><p>#BRAINLYFAST</p><br />
