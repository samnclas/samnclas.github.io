                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Asan yung story??</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>papano ko malalaman?</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>diko po alam sagot pero eto po ung story</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>That Jim and Della are simple working class people is revealed in Della's speech: ""Cut it off and sold it," said Della. "Don't you like me just as well, anyhow? I'm me without my hair, ain't I?" That they are young and in love is revealed by the biased limited third-person narrator: "Poor fellow, he was only twenty-two--and to be burdened with a family!" That they are foolish in material ways is clearly stated by the narrator: "two foolish children in a flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each other." That the narrator is representing their material foolishness as spiritual wisdom that reflects the wise sacrifices of the first Christmas Magi is made clear by O. Henry's didactic ending: "these two were the wisest."</p><p></p><p>Della is an emotional young woman who is maybe not yet twenty, since Jim is but twenty-two. She is demonstrative with her feelings and generous in her love. While she is foolish in her longings and desires for a better life, "her heart had simply craved and yearned over [the combs]," she seems to be wise in her spirit of giving (though if it weren't Christmas, her actions might not have the same effect). She is given to sobbing loudly and letting tears fall on the carpet, and she acts impetuously without thinking things through, such as not thinking about how to apportion the $20 gotten for from her hair to buy a gift and expand their budget.</p><p></p><p>Jim is a responsible working man, though very young and already with Della to provide for. He is as generously giving and sacrificial as she. He is philosophical about loss; he sat on the sofa with his hands behind his head and suggested they save the gifts for awhile. He bases his love for Della on deep qualities, not on superficialities. Jim seemingly similarly used the whole value received from his watch sale for Della's gift without thought to buying a lesser gift and to expanding their budget. Neither have foresight though both are praised by O. Henry as sacrificially giving and loving.</p><br />

                        <p>Della is the point-of-view character in "The Gift of the Magi." She and Jim have the same problems: each wants to buy the other a nice Christmas present, and neither of them has any money.But it would be a mistake to try to write an essay about this story as if both Della and Jim have problems of equal weight.</p><br />

                        The Gift of the Magi<p>In the Catholic/Christian religious tradition, Magi (The Magi) are the representations of the Three Wise Men, Three Kings, or Eastern Kings who arrived to Bethlehem on December 25 to bring gifts for Jesus' birth.</p>What do magi do? Refer to Jim and Della's traits in your response.<p></p>In the timeless short story, The Gift of the Magi by O. Henry, Jim and Della, a young married couple who are having financial problems, are described. Each of them wants to give their spouse a special present for Christmas, but because they don't have enough money, they must resort to drastic tactics. Della's long, gorgeous hair was her most valued item, whereas Jim's was his gold pocket watch. Della sold her hair to buy a chain for Jim's pocket watch, and Jim sold his watch to buy some combs for Della's hair.<p></p><p>People adore the narrative because<strong> it serves as a reminder that true love </strong>is defined by its willingness to sacrifice for others. Given that the central theme of the tale of Christ's birth is sacrifice, this notion suits the meaning of Christmas admirably. According to Galatians 4:5, Jesus Christ was born to die and that He died for us. You will name Him Jesus because He will save His people from their sins, the angel told Joseph (Matt. 1 :21).</p><p></p><p></p><p>Story of The Gift of the Magi:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/18954035</p><p>#SPJ4</p><br />

What is the theme of the story?5. If you were Jim or Della, would you have done the same? Explain your answer.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer: </strong><strong>1.For example, it would include things like the time period of the event, the country or place or society in which it takes place, or the events that are happening at the time outside of the story, such as "in colonial times" or "during the American Civil War"</strong></p><p><strong>              2.One could argue that Jim and Della Young are flat characters. Round characters are complex, and they would take many, many sentences to fully describe. Flat characters, however, are relatively simple and can be summed up quickly, in one or two sentences.</strong></p><p><strong>              3.Gold, a metal, is a symbol of earthly kingship; frankincense, an incense, is a symbol of godliness; and myrrh, an embalming oil, is a symbol of death. Thus the gifts were given in recognition of Jesus's importance within the Christian story. In "The Gift of the Magi," the magi symbolize wisdom.</strong></p><p><strong>                4.The theme of a story is what the author is trying to convey — in other words, the central idea of the story. Short stories often have just one theme, whereas novels usually have multiple themes.</strong></p><p><strong>               5.I'd be absolutely delighted by Jim's gift. It would show how incredibly kind and considerate he is, and how he's always thinking of me. Although the gift may be technically useless now I've shaved off most of my lovely locks, it's the thought that counts. In any case, my hair can always grow back, and when it does, the combs will still be there. The best things come to those who wait, as they say, and Jim's wonderful gift will be all the more special for having to wait to use it.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>More than anything else, Jim's thoughtful gift confirms the strength of his and Della's marriage, based as it is on a solid foundation of mutual love and respect. And that, I'm sure, would be very important indeed for Della—maybe the most important thing of all.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>The Gift of Magi</strong></p><p>1. The important decision that Della had to make on the unforgettable day is to sold her long, beautiful hair in order to buy a present for her husband Jim.</p><p>2. The author had expressed Della's ordeal of going through with her hair cut short when the author had written the following lines..."You need not to look for it. It's sold, I tell you - sold and gone too. It's Christmas eve, boy. Be good to me for it went for you. Maybe the hairs of my head were numbered, but nobody could ever count my love for you." These lines honestly shows how precious her hair was for Della but her love for her husband is incomparable, it is priceless that even her greatest possession could be given up just to prove her love for him. On the other hand, the author might have expressed Della's ordeal of not going through with her hair cut short when the author have written the lines..."But she hugged them to her bosom, and at length she was able to look up with dim smile and say: My hair grows so fast Jim!" These lines shows expressively how Della treasured the gift that comes from her husband. The comb may seem to be useless for her at the moment but she doesn't want Jim to be offended so she tries to hide her regret for having her hair cut and instead she just say that her hair will soon grow again.</p><p>3. Jim had to part away from his gold watch in order to but a Christmas gift for his wife Della.</p><p>4. The author described the people who sacrificed their greatest treasures for someone they love as Magi. Magi are the wise men who have brought presents for the baby Jesus.</p><p>5. The author had claimed the high emotions to bring the selection to a close by simply relating the characters of the story to a Magi. The Magi who have brought gifts to the baby called Jesus. The author said that anybody who give and receive gifts are the wisest.</p><br />
